## Introduction

The *Vijñāna Bhairava Tantra* (VBT) stands as one of the most profound and enduring jewels of Indian spiritual literature, a concise yet expansive manual for awakening to the non-dual nature of reality. Emerging from the fertile philosophical soil of Kashmir Shaivism, this text transcends its historical origins to offer timeless guidance on meditation and self-realization. Often described as a "manual for self-realization" or a treasury of contemplative practices, the VBT distills the essence of Tantric wisdom into a dialogue that bridges the divine and the human, the transcendent and the immanent. In this introduction, we explore its historical context, philosophical underpinnings, structural elegance, key commentators and translations, and its enduring influence in modern spiritual discourse. This edition aims to present the text in a form that honors its ancient roots while making it accessible to contemporary seekers, drawing on refined translations and commentaries to illuminate its radiant core.

#### Historical Context and Origins

The *Vijñāna Bhairava Tantra* is embedded within the broader corpus of Śaiva Tantra, specifically as a chapter or excerpt from the larger *Rudrayāmala Tantra*, a foundational scripture in the Bhairava Tantra tradition. This tradition, associated with the fierce yet liberating aspect of Śiva as Bhairava (the "terrifying" or "awesome" one), emphasizes non-dual awareness and the integration of worldly experience into spiritual practice. The text's exact date of composition remains a subject of scholarly debate, reflecting the challenges of dating Tantric works, which were often transmitted orally before being committed to writing. Jaideva Singh, a prominent 20th-century translator and scholar, suggests a timeframe between the 7th and 8th centuries CE, based on linguistic and doctrinal affinities with other Śaiva texts. Other estimates place it slightly later, around the 8th to 9th centuries, aligning it with the flourishing of Kashmir Shaivism during this period. Some traditional accounts, rooted in the mythic timelessness of Tantra, attribute it to an even earlier era, potentially tracing back thousands of years to the oral lineages of Siddhas and Rishis in the Śaiva tradition.

Authorship, in the conventional sense, is not ascribed to a single human figure but to the divine itself. The VBT is presented as a revealed dialogue between Bhairava (Śiva) and Bhairavī (the Devī or Śakti), embodying the eternal interplay of consciousness and its dynamic power. This format is characteristic of Tantric scriptures, where revelation unfolds through intimate conversation, underscoring the relational and experiential nature of Tantra. The text belongs to the Kaula or Trika lineage of Kashmir Shaivism, a non-dualistic (Advaita) school that emerged in the Kashmir Valley around the 8th century. Kashmir Shaivism, also known as Trika (from "tri," meaning three, referring to the triad of Śiva, Śakti, and Nara—the divine, energy, and individual soul), represents a synthesis of earlier Vedic, Upaniṣadic, and Tantric elements, refined into a sophisticated philosophy of non-duality.

The VBT's provenance is further illuminated by its early references in the works of Abhinavagupta (c. 950–1016 CE), the polymath philosopher and mystic who systematized Kashmir Shaivism. Abhinavagupta cites it as the *Śiva-jñāna-upaniṣad*, indicating its status as an "Upaniṣad of Śiva's knowledge" by the 10th century. This suggests the text was already well-established in Śaiva circles by then. Manuscripts of the VBT were first published in the early 20th century as part of the Kashmir Series of Texts and Studies (1918), bringing it to wider scholarly attention. Its roots in the Bhairava Tantras—a group of 64 monistic Tantras—highlight its place within the esoteric "left-hand" (Kaula) paths, which embrace the world as divine play (*līlā*) rather than illusion (*māyā*).

#### Philosophical Framework

At its heart, the *Vijñāna Bhairava Tantra* articulates a radical non-dualism where the ultimate reality—Bhairava—is pure consciousness (*vijñāna* or *cit*), pervading all phenomena without division. This aligns with the core tenets of Kashmir Shaivism, which posits that the universe is a spontaneous emanation of Śiva's consciousness, not a separate creation. Unlike dualistic Tantra or Vedānta traditions that emphasize renunciation or transcendence of the world, the VBT celebrates immersion in sensory and experiential life as a path to realization. The term *vijñāna* here denotes not mere intellectual knowledge but a direct, embodied awareness of one's divine nature—Bhairava as the "fearsome" aspect of Śiva, symbolizing the dissolution of egoic limitations.

Philosophically, the text integrates the three *upāyas* (means or approaches) of Trika Shaivism: *āṇavopāya* (methods involving the body, breath, and senses), *śāktopāya* (energetic and mental practices), and *śāmbhavopāya* (direct recognition without effort). These are not hierarchical but adaptive, tailored to the practitioner's readiness. The VBT's 112 *dhāraṇās* (centering techniques or meditations) exemplify this, drawing from everyday experiences like breath, sound, emotion, and void to catalyze recognition (*pratyabhijñā*) of the Self as Śiva. This approach demystifies enlightenment, presenting it not as a distant goal but as an innate reality obscured by conceptual veils. The text's emphasis on *bhāvanā* (imaginative or contemplative realization) underscores the creative power of consciousness to manifest and dissolve forms, aligning with the Spanda (vibration) doctrine of Kashmir Shaivism.

Significantly, the VBT bridges ritual and non-ritual paths, critiquing external forms while transmuting them into inner realizations. It affirms that ultimate truth (*tattva*) transcends all categorizations, yet appears through them as divine play. This non-dual stance has profound implications: liberation (*mokṣa*) is not escape from the world but recognition of its inherent divinity, a theme that resonates with modern existential and phenomenological philosophies.

#### Structure and Content

Comprising 163 Sanskrit *anuṣṭubh* stanzas, the VBT is structured as an intimate dialogue. It opens with the Devī expressing lingering doubt despite comprehensive teachings from the *Rudrayāmala*, prompting Bhairava to reveal 112 *dhāraṇās*—techniques ranging from breath awareness and sensory immersion to contemplation of void and spontaneous joy. These are not prescriptive rituals but flexible "centering" practices (*dhāraṇā*, from *dhṛ* meaning "to hold" or "sustain"), designed to dissolve dualistic perception. The text progresses from negation of conceptual forms (verses 1–23) to practical methods (24–139), culminating in non-dual fruition and transmission warnings (140–163).

The 112 techniques are often grouped thematically: breath (*prāṇa*) practices predominate, reflecting Tantra's emphasis on vital energy, while others involve sound (*nāda*), emotion, or everyday activities like eating or sexual union. This inclusivity makes the VBT a "universal Tantra," adaptable across temperaments and contexts, embodying Trika's triad of individual (*aṇu*), energy (*śakti*), and divine (*śambhu*).

#### Key Commentators and Translations

The VBT's interpretive history begins with Abhinavagupta, whose *Tantrāloka* and other works reference it as a pinnacle of Śaiva insight. Kshemarāja (11th century) provided a commentary emphasizing its alignment with Pratyabhijñā philosophy. In the modern era, Swami Lakshmanjoo (1907–1991), the last direct lineage holder of Kashmir Shaivism, offered oral teachings that revitalized the tradition. His commentaries, compiled by John Hughes, focus on practical application and Sahaja (natural) realization.

Translations abound: Lilian Silburn's 1961 French version was pioneering, emphasizing yogic practices. Jaideva Singh's 1979 English translation, informed by Lakshmanjoo, includes commentaries and is widely regarded as authoritative. Bettina Bäumer's work with Lakshmanjoo offers a centering-awareness focus. Paul Reps and Daniel Odier provide poetic interpretations, while Osho's *The Book of Secrets* (1974) expands the 112 techniques into discursive volumes, influencing global spirituality. Contemporary scholars like Christopher Wallis (Hareesh) and Mark Dyczkowski provide nuanced analyses, correcting misconceptions and highlighting its non-dual depth.

#### Modern Relevance and Influence

In the contemporary world, the VBT's influence extends beyond academia into yoga, mindfulness, and psychology. Its techniques resonate with secular meditation practices, such as breath awareness in mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) or sensory immersion in somatic therapies. Osho's popularization has made it a staple in New Age and neo-Tantra circles, though sometimes diluted. Lakshmanjoo's legacy, through organizations like the Lakshmanjoo Academy, continues to inspire global students.

The text's emphasis on direct experience over dogma speaks to postmodern seekers navigating secularism and spirituality. In an era of cognitive overload, its call to recognize the divine in the mundane offers a antidote to alienation. Scholarly interest persists, with studies exploring its phenomenological parallels to Western thinkers like Heidegger or Merleau-Ponty, or its applications in neuroscience of meditation.

Ultimately, the *Vijñāna Bhairava Tantra* invites not intellectual mastery but lived embodiment. As Bhairava declares, true realization arises when forms dissolve into the boundless sky of awareness. This edition, with its refined translations and layered commentaries, seeks to facilitate that awakening, bridging ancient wisdom and modern inquiry.


## Editorial Conventions

This edition of the **Vijñāna Bhairava Tantra** draws primarily from Swami Lakshmanjoo's oral teachings, as preserved in *Vijñāna Bhairava: The Practice of Centring Awareness* (originally translated by Bettina Bäumer with commentary by Swami Lakshmanjoo). It refines that foundational material for contemporary readers while honoring the living tradition of Kashmir Shaivism.

The translation and commentary were developed using a method termed **self-instructing iterative text diffusion**: a structured, multi-cycle process in which the language model generates, evaluates, and progressively refines each section against internalized criteria: doctrinal fidelity, linguistic elegance, conceptual precision, and experiential resonance. Unlike open-ended generation, this process is grounded in a fixed, authoritative source text and cross-referenced against additional primary materials (including unpublished transcripts, parallel Sanskrit editions, and Lakshmanjoo’s other recorded discourses). This access to verified source content enables the system to correct misinterpretations, resolve ambiguities, and maintain terminological consistency across the entire tantra.

This approach is especially valuable for tasks demanding strict adherence to doctrinal and stylistic parameters—such as rendering tantric terminology with semantic integrity (*visarga* as “emission,” not “release”; *vimala* as “stainless,” not merely “pure”) or expressing non-dual insights without falling into conceptual reification. By anchoring each revision in concrete source evidence and applying consistent interpretive guidelines derived from the Trika tradition, the process approximates the precision of a trained practitioner’s expression, even when working through the constraints of a digital medium.

While iterative self-correction significantly enhances textual coherence and alignment with historical teachings, soteriological depth cannot arise from algorithmic refinement alone. To ensure the final rendering reflects not only accuracy but also the living pulse of realization, **the model was guided at critical junctures**—phrasing was adjusted, superficial interpretations were rejected, and the output was consistently reoriented toward the non-conceptual heart of the teaching. In this way, the model served as a responsive instrument, while discernment, lineage awareness, and contemplative insight remained anchored in direct human oversight.

When guided by reliable source material and curated by an experienced practitioner, this method becomes a powerful tool for clarifying, organizing, and conveying esoteric teachings with unusual fidelity where precision and accessibility must coexist.

#### Structure of Each Section
Each verse or group of verses follows this consistent format:

- **[Devanagari]**
  The original Sanskrit text appears in clean, standardized Devanagari script, corrected from any prior transcription errors and aligned with established scholarly editions.

- **[IAST Romanized]**
  A precise International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration (IAST) rendering includes full diacritics for accurate pronunciation and scholarly reference.

- **[Translation]**
  The English translation prioritizes doctrinal fidelity to the non-dual Trika perspective, combined with literary elegance, natural rhythm, and clarity. It avoids overly literal stiffness or excessive paraphrase, aiming for a rendering that is both poetically evocative and accessible to modern readers without compromising the text's profound subtlety.

- **[Lakshmanjoo's Transmission]**
  This draws directly from Swami Lakshmanjoo's spoken expositions. The original informal, oral style—delivered in Q&A sessions—has been carefully edited for grammatical polish, flow, and readability in English. Every substantive insight, explanation, and emphasis from the Swami remains intact; only the expression has been refined to enhance comprehension while preserving his direct, experiential voice.

- **[Extended Commentary]**
  This entirely new layer offers standalone reflections in universal, non-sectarian language. It avoids references to specific lineages, texts, or technical terminology, instead pointing timelessly and directly to the verse's deepest meaning in a way that invites immediate insight and recognition.

#### Terminology and Style
- Key Sanskrit terms (e.g., *Bhairava*, *Śakti*, *visarga*) retain their original form on first prominent appearance, with context providing implicit meaning rather than glosses, to maintain the text's immersive quality.
- Consistent English equivalents have been chosen for recurring concepts (e.g., "plenitude" for states of fullness; "immersion" for absorptive realization; "recognition" for direct awakening) to ensure thematic coherence across the entire tantra.
- The translation and commentaries emphasize the text's core teaching: the effortless revelation of innate wholeness through direct awareness, free from contrived effort or conceptual overlay.

This edition seeks not merely to inform but to transmit—to serve as a living mirror for the reader's own recognition of the ever-present reality celebrated in these verses. It is offered with deep reverence to the tradition and to Swami Lakshmanjoo, the last great master in its unbroken lineage.

## Translator's Invocation

When one glimpses that the boundless sky of awareness has never been confined by the clouds of thought—that every breath, every sensation, every heartbeat is already saturated with the luminous fullness of Bhairava—then, in that instant of recognition, the world does not vanish but becomes transparent. This transparency is not emptiness as absence, but as overflowing completeness—the seamless unity of Śiva and Śakti dancing as the ordinary miracle of being.

Bhairava is not a deity to be worshipped elsewhere, but the unbroken wholeness of the ground in which all appearances float like stars in empty sky. His form is not shaped by concepts but revealed in the space between breaths, between thoughts, between the outstretched arms and the void beneath them. He witnesses not as a separate observer but as the very field of witnessing itself—prior to all division, untouched by time's fire, free from the subtle contractions of "I" and "mine."

Bhairavī is not apart from him but is his dynamic face, the spontaneous pulse of recognition that floods the heart when all seeking collapses. She is the 112 doorways, not as methods to perfect but as mirrors held up to what has always been awake. Her nectar is not attained but tasted when the mind renders itself supportless—when even the trace of spiritual ambition dissolves like salt in water.

This text does not lead to a destination but unmasks the illusion of having departed. It is not a map but a mirror. Its words are not instructions but fingers pointing to the luminous space where all instructions vanish. May this translation not add another veil but become a window—clear, transparent, allowing the living breath of the tantra to awaken the same recognition in you that has never departed from you.

May the 112 gateways reveal not a path to walk but the ever-present ground on which you already stand—as you are, here and now, utterly free.

</div>

<p class="center">Lakshmanjoo's Transmission</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>The Devī acknowledges that she has received the entirety of the Trika teaching—the doctrine that emerges from the Rudra Yāmala Tantra, which itself springs from the union of Bhairava and Bhairavī. She confirms she has been given not only the essence but every nuanced subdivision (<em>sārat-sāra-vibhāga</em>)—the full spectrum from the subtlest to the most concrete. Despite this comprehensive transmission, her inner uncertainty remains unresolved. This sets the stage for Bhairava’s forthcoming 112 dhāraṇās—methods of direct recognition—each a doorway to immediate realization.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Extended Commentary</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>The Devī here is not an ignorant seeker but the embodiment of awakened awareness, posing the question that lives in every sincere practitioner: even after hearing the highest truth, why does the mind still waver? This is not a failure of intellect but a testament to the depth of conditioning that obscures innate freedom. The “doubt” she refers to isn’t skepticism—it’s the subtle residue of separation, the lingering sense that realization is something yet to be achieved. The text thus begins not with doctrine but with longing, establishing that true understanding arises not from accumulation of knowledge but from direct, unmediated recognition. The mention of the Rudra Yāmala signifies that what follows is not philosophical speculation but a revealed transmission—a living current of wisdom meant to ignite, not inform. May this opening invite an honest self-inquiry: Do I seek more information, or am I ready to meet what is already fully present?</p>

</div>

<p class="center">Lakshmanjoo's Transmission</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>The Devī continues her inquiry by presenting multiple traditional formulations of the ultimate reality, each drawn from Tantric cosmology. She asks whether the true nature (tattva) is constituted by sabda-rāśi— the entire spectrum of mantric sound from 'a' to 'kṣa'; or whether it manifests through the navātma, the nine tattvas ranging from prakṛti to Śiva; or as the triśira (three-headed) Bhairava representing icchā, jñāna, and kriyā śaktis; or as the triad of śaktis themselves. She further questions whether it is the ascent through nāda (vibration), bindu (point of condensation), ardhacandra (crescent), and nirodhikā (the threshold of dissolution); or the anākṣa—the vowel-less, unpronounceable essence that dwells within the cakras; or simply the self-luminous nature of śakti itself. Each option reflects a valid path within the tradition, yet the Devī seeks the one essential truth that makes all paths unnecessary.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Extended Commentary</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>These verses are not a catalog of philosophical alternatives but a map of experiential thresholds. The Goddess, though omniscient in essence, articulates the confusion that arises when spiritual knowledge remains conceptual. The “matrix of sound” (sabda-rāśi) points to the idea that reality vibrates as language—yet the seeker may mistake the map for the territory. The “ninefold division” references stages of contraction and expansion in consciousness, but liberation isn’t found by traversing them—it’s realized when the traveler vanishes. The “three-headed Bhairava” symbolizes the triune dynamism of will, knowledge, and action, yet the question implies: must I assemble these pieces, or are they already whole?</p>
<p>The ascent through nāda, bindu, and ardhacandra describes subtle inner processes, but the true “point of stillness” (nirodhikā) isn’t a stage to reach—it’s the silent backdrop against which all movement appears. The “vowel-less resonance” (anākṣa) cannot be spoken because it is prior to articulation; it is awareness itself, humming beneath thought. And the final suggestion—that it is simply “the nature of śakti”—cuts through all complexity: the essence isn’t hidden in techniques or symbols; it is the ever-present power that animates both question and silence.</p>
<p>May this passage be an invitation to stop collecting answers and instead feel the living space from which the question arises. The “real essence” isn’t any of these forms—it is what remains when all forms, including spiritual ones, are seen as transient expressions of that which never departs.</p>

would that not contradict its very nature as supreme?</p>

</div>

<p class="center">Lakshmanjoo's Transmission</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>The Devī now probes the paradox of embodiment: If the ultimate reality—parā śakti—is truly beyond all limitation, how can it manifest in mantra (varṇa) or form (deha)? She distinguishes three modes: parā (transcendent), aparā (immanent), and parāparā (the bridge between). Each may appear in sakala-rūpa—embodied, articulated forms such as specific mantras (e.g., “sauḥ”) or visualized deities. But if parā itself were to assume such a differentiated form, its very supremacy (paratvam) would be undermined, for supremacy implies indivisibility (niṣkala). Yet, paradoxically, the tradition affirms that the formless does appear in form—not as limitation, but as play (līlā). Its emphasized that paratva is not attainable through mere manipulation of mantras or visualization of forms unless these are recognized as spontaneous expressions of that which is already whole. The true paratva remains untouched by both division (sakalatva) and its absence (niṣkalatva)—it is beyond both.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Extended Commentary</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>These verses cut to the heart of a perpetual tension in spiritual life: the relationship between the absolute and its appearances. The Goddess is not asking for definitions—she is exposing the trap of reification. To imagine the supreme as “formless” in opposition to “form” is already to divide what cannot be split. Similarly, to treat mantra or visualization as mere tools to reach a formless goal is to miss their true nature: they are not ladders to climb but mirrors held up to that which is already awake.</p>
<p>The phrase “niṣkalatvena sakalatvena vā bhavet” is pivotal—it declares that the supreme cannot be reduced either to pure undifferentiatedness or to fragmented multiplicity. It is neither abstract void nor assembled parts. It is the living ground in which both silence and sound arise, equally. When the text says paratvam tad virudhyate—if parā took on the same kind of form as aparā, its supremacy would vanish.</p>
<p>The key lies in recognition, not construction. A mantra like “sauḥ” is not a code to unlock a distant state; it is the vibration of awareness already present. The form of a deity is not an external ideal to emulate but the spontaneous icon of one’s own nature. Parā appears as parāparā and aparā not because it changes, but because perception shifts. In that light, every syllable, every gesture, every breath becomes a doorway—not because it leads somewhere, but because it reveals where we have always been.</p>

</div>

<p class="center">Lakshmanjoo's Transmission</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>Bhairava commends the Devī's question as piercing to the core of all Tantric revelation. He affirms that what he is about to disclose—though guarded as the most confidential—is being shared precisely because of her readiness. He then transforms our understanding of spiritual forms: every embodied form (<em>sakala-rūpa</em>), every mantric structure, every cosmological map is not merely "without essence," but are luminous expressions of the one reality appearing as many. They are likened to sphurajāla (a net of shimmering sparks) and gandharva-nagar (the illusory city in the air)—not to dismiss them as false, but to free us from fixation while honoring their sacred function.</p>
<p>These forms exist in the Āgamas not as ultimate truths to be clung to, but living mirrors that reflect back to us what we already are. Their purpose is not to create new realities, but to reveal the ever-present ground of being that animates both form and formlessness. The true revelation lies not in rejecting these constructs, but in seeing through them to what cannot be constructed or deconstructed—Bhairava himself, who is not other than the awareness in which all forms arise.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Extended Commentary</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>Bhairava's response is not a demolition but a liberation. After the Devī meticulously lists every known framework—mantra sequences, emanation models, energetic diagrams—he transforms them from destinations into doorways. These forms are not lies, but living expressions of truth wearing the garment of form. They are not rejected but recognized: like waves on the ocean, they have no existence separate from the sea that births and holds them.</p>
<p>The similes—magic, dream, sky-city—are not metaphors of falsehood, but of transience and freedom. A dream is real while it lasts, yet wise dreamers know its nature. Likewise, spiritual forms arise within awareness, serve their purpose, and dissolve. To cling to them as ultimate is to confuse the dance for the dancer; to reject them entirely is to deny the very medium of revelation.</p>
<p>The phrase "sphurajālavat"—like a net of shimmering sparks—captures the dynamic, momentary play of manifestation. Each spark is vivid, yet none holds permanence. The teaching here is not anti-ritual or anti-form, but pro-recognition. It invites a seeing-through that does not discard the mirror, but recognizes the face it reflects.</p>
<p>And yet, precisely because the truth is "hidden even from the hidden," it cannot be transmitted through doctrine alone. That is why Bhairava speaks—not to explain, but to point beyond explanation. His words are themselves part of the net, but when seen clearly, the net becomes the sky. The real transmission occurs not in the words themselves, but in the recognition that sparks when you see your own nature reflected in them.</p>
<p>Here's the practical wisdom this teaching offers: while forms may be transparent, they are not meaningless. The ritual, the mantra, the visualization—these are not to be abandoned until their purpose is fulfilled. For those who still need support, the form is the path; for those who see through form, even formlessness is just another appearance. The advanced practitioner doesn't reject outer practice—they no longer need it as support, yet may still engage with it as expression. They worship not because they believe the deity is separate, but because worship becomes the natural overflow of recognizing the divine everywhere.</p>
<p>This is how we navigate the seeming paradox: honor the form while seeing its transparency. Light the lamp with devotion, yet know the light was never in the flame but in the awareness that sees it. Chant the mantra with full voice, yet rest in the silence that holds the sound. The world of form is not a barrier to truth—it is truth appearing as world.</p>
<p>Look now at your own hand. See its solidity, its form, its function. Now look deeper. Feel the life that animates it, the awareness that knows it. That life, that awareness—unchanging amidst all changing forms—is Bhairava. The hand is not less real for being transparent to this reality; it is more real, more alive, precisely because it is seen as a dance of the divine.</p>
<p>This is not philosophy to believe, but reality to recognize. The forms around you right now—this text, the room, your breath—are not obstacles to awakening. They are the very medium through which awakening recognizes itself. Don't turn away from the world to find truth. Turn toward the world with eyes that see through to what has never departed.</p>
<p>In that seeing, there is no rejection of form, no transcendence of the world. There is only the unbroken wholeness that is Bhairava—appearing as this very moment, this very breath, this very recognition that needs no form and fears no form.</p>

</div>

<p class="center">Lakshmanjoo's Transmission</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>Bhairava clarifies that all previously mentioned formulations—whether ninefold tattvas, mantric sequences, triune deities, or triadic śaktis—are not descriptions of reality itself, but provisional supports for those whose awareness remains entangled in duality.</p>
<p>They are given solely as provisional supports (dhyānārthaṃ) for meditation by those whose intellect is “confused” (bhrānta-buddhi) and whose lives are dominated by ritual display (kriyā-ḍambara)—mere external observance without inner recognition. Such individuals are “vikalpa-nihitātman”—their very sense of self is embedded in thought-constructs. Hence, the Tantras offer these forms as skillful means, not as ultimate truth. But in essence (tattvataḥ), Bhairava transcends all such divisions: he is not limited to navātman, not confined to sabda-rāśi, not personified as triśira, and not partitioned into three śaktis. He is beyond all enumeration.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Extended Commentary</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>Verse 10 delivers a stark diagnosis: the elaborate systems of mantra, form, and cosmology are not revelations of what is, but remedies for what obscures. They are not for the awakened, but for those still mistaking sound for silence, effort for ease, and ritual for realization. The phrase “kriyā-ḍambara-vartinām” cuts deep—it names the performance of spirituality, the inflation of practice into identity, the substitution of outer correctness for inner clarity.</p>
<p>But verse 11 is the blade that severs the root: “In truth…”—tattvataḥ—none of these hold. Not because they are false, but because truth does not reside in categories. The nine states, the fifty letters, the three heads, the triple śaktis—all are fingers pointing, none the moon. To insist that Bhairava “is” any of these is to freeze the infinite in a frame.</p>
<p>This is not nihilism. It is the affirmation of a reality so immediate it cannot be named, so whole it cannot be divided—not even into “transcendent” and “immanent.” The dissolution of these constructs is not loss but homecoming. When the mind stops assembling reality from pieces, what remains is not emptiness, but fullness without boundary: Bhairava, not as object of worship, but as the uncontrived ground of all experience.</p>

</div>

<p class="center">Lakshmanjoo's Transmission</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>Bhairava now strips away even the subtlest frameworks. The inner journey through nāda, bindu, ardhacandra, nirodhikā, and the cakra system—often held as the pinnacle of yogic practice—is declared not to be the essence of Bhairava. Nor is he reducible to śakti-svarūpa, the self-expression of power. These are all provisional. They serve as “bāla-vibhīṣikā”—childhood fables used to deter immature minds from harmful tendencies—or as “mātṛ-modaka,” a sweet lure to get the reluctant to begin. The term aprabuddha-mati refers to those whose understanding has not yet awakened to non-dual awareness. For them, the Tantras offer structured paths to channel restless energy and cultivate discipline. But these are introductory devices (pravṛttyartham udāhṛtam)—meant to initiate movement, not to be mistaken for the destination. The true path lies beyond all such scaffolding.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Extended Commentary</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>These verses are a quiet detonation of spiritual idealism. Every cherished model—whether gross ritual or subtle energetic ascent—is placed in its proper context: a pedagogical tool, not a revelation. The imagery is precise. “Bāla-vibhīṣikā” (ghost stories for children) captures how fear-based disciplines function: they impose order through imagined consequences, not through insight. “Mātṛ-modaka” (mother’s sweet) reveals the compassionate deception of grace: offering something pleasurable to lead one toward what is necessary but initially unpalatable.</p>
<p>But the core teaching is this: Bhairava is not any of these. Not because they are wrong, but because he is prior to all description. Nāda, bindu, cakras—these arise within awareness; they do not constitute it. Even “śakti-svarūpa,” the spontaneous effulgence of power, is a movement within the stillness that is Bhairava.</p>
<p>The phrase “pravṛttyartham udāhṛtam” is key: “spoken for the sake of starting.” Not for staying. The danger is not in beginning with form, but in forgetting that all form is transitional. The true path begins when the seeker stops seeking a method and rests in what needs no support. That is not taught—it is recognized when every prop is seen as such and quietly set aside.</p>

</div>

<p class="center">Lakshmanjoo's Transmission</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>Bhairava now reveals the actual nature of the ultimate state, not as abstract philosophy but as your immediate experience when all conceptual overlay falls away. It is utterly free from spatial directions, temporal sequence, and conceptual quantification (<em>dik-kāla-kalana-unmukta</em>). There is no "here" or "there," no sacred site that can contain it. It is without any particular locus or label (<em>deśoddēśāviśeṣiṇam</em>). Because it transcends all categories, it is "akathya," inexpressible in principle, not merely in practice.</p>
<p>Yet it is not remote. It is the innermost delight of direct experience, not mediated by mind (<em>antaḥ svānubhavānanda</em>). It lies "vikalponmukha-gocaram," beyond the reach of vikalpa (conceptual thinking), not as an absence, but as a luminous fullness ("bharitākārā"). This fullness is not partial or qualified; it is immaculate and all-encompassing (<em>vimalaṃ viśva-pūraṇam</em>).</p>
<p>Most importantly, Bhairavī and Bhairava are not two. The feminine and masculine are metaphors for dynamic stillness and still dynamism—two expressions of one indivisible reality. Hence, in this supreme tattva, the duality of worshipper and worshipped collapses. There is no "other" to adore, and no separate self to be fulfilled. This is not philosophical speculation—it is the reality you recognize when thought subsides and pure awareness stands revealed.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Extended Commentary</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>These verses mark the turning point: from negation of forms to affirmation of what remains when all forms fall away. The state described is not a mystical experience among others—it is the ground of all experience, prior to separation.</p>
<p>Right now, as you read these words, notice the space in which they appear. That space is not an object—it has no color, no shape, no boundaries. It cannot be located in front of you or behind you. It simply is. That space—awareness itself—is what Bhairava describes.</p>
<p>"Free from direction, time, and measure" means it cannot be located, scheduled, or quantified. It is not "in" the heart, "above" the head, or "after" years of practice. The fullness described is not a state to achieve but the ever-present nature of awareness itself. When you stop looking for it somewhere else, you find it here—now—in the simple act of reading, breathing, being.</p>
<p>"Inexpressible" does not mean ineffable in a poetic sense, but logically unspeakable—because language depends on distinction, and this is distinctionless. Yet it is not silent in the way silence opposes sound; it is the open space in which both sound and silence arise. When you look at your hand, you see form—but the awareness that sees has no form. That formless seeing is Bhairava.</p>
<p>"Bliss of self-recognition" is not emotional euphoria, but the quiet certainty of being what one is—prior to identity, untouched by gain or loss. It is not an experience that comes and goes; it is the steady ground beneath all changing experience. When your mind is agitated, that ground remains undisturbed. When your mind is calm, that ground is not enhanced. It is always already whole.</p>
<p>The final question—"who is to be worshipped, and who could possibly be satisfied?"—is not rhetorical. It dismantles the entire architecture of seeking. Worship implies distance; satisfaction implies lack. Here, both are illusions. The fullness described does not fill a void—it reveals there never was one.</p>
<p>Try this now: close your eyes for just a moment. Feel the space of awareness that holds your thoughts, sensations, and breath. That space is not yours—it is what you are. That space is not waiting to be filled—it is already overflowing with the fullness of being itself. In that instant of recognition, concepts fall away and reality stands revealed.</p>
<p>This is not a state to attain, but the ever-present nature of awareness itself—Bhairava, not as a deity to be worshipped elsewhere, but as the unbroken wholeness of the ground in which all appearances float, like stars in empty sky.</p>
<p>When you open your eyes again, the room, the text, your breath—they have not changed. But when seen from this ground of recognition, they reveal themselves as expressions of that same fullness. The sacred is not elsewhere—it is here, in the ordinary miracle of awareness recognizing itself.</p>

<h3>Bhairava And Bhairavi</h3>

<p class="sanskrit-block">

<div class="translation">
<p>The state of Bhairava<br />
that is sung of in the Tantras—<br />
this very state, in its supreme form,<br />
is declared to be the highest Goddess, Parādevī.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Lakshmanjoo's Transmission</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>This verse establishes the essential identity between Bhairava and Bhairavī. The state praised in the Tantras as Bhairava’s ultimate nature is none other than Parādevī—not a separate entity, but his supreme form (<em>para-rūpa</em>)." There is no hierarchy here, no descent from a higher masculine principle to a lower feminine one. Rather, the feminine is the very face of the masculine, and the masculine the silent depth of the feminine.</p>
<p>Bhairava, as pure subjectivity—the Knower—cannot be objectified. To seek him as an experience is to miss him, for he is the experiencer. Yet when this Knower turns toward manifestation, he appears as Bhairavī: dynamic, luminous, accessible. It is in her field—Parvati’s domain—that the path unfolds, because she is both the means and the revelation. The 112 dhāraṇās that follow are not techniques to reach Bhairava; they are invitations to recognize that awareness which is already awake in sensation, breath, sound, and silence—this is Parādevī in motion.</p>
<p>Thus, the supreme state is not beyond the world, but the world seen without division. Parādevī is not “lower” than Bhairava; she is Bhairava in the act of self-recognition through form. The journey is not away from experience, but into its heart—where every perception becomes a doorway, because every perception arises within her.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Extended Commentary</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>This verse resolves the apparent tension between transcendence and immanence. Bhairava—as absolute subjectivity—cannot be seen, known, or reached, because he is the seeing itself. But precisely because he is everything, he appears as Parādevī: the living presence in which all phenomena shimmer.</p>
<p>The phrase “para-rūpeṇa parā-devī” is key: the highest form of the highest reality is the Goddess. This is not metaphor. It means that the ultimate is not static void, but vibrant self-awareness—responsive, intimate, and immediate. The 112 practices that follow are not paths to her; they are her unfolding in attention.</p>
<p>To enter one of those gateways—to rest in the pause between breaths, to dissolve into a distant sound, to feel the body as empty space—is not to “attain” anything. It is to allow the mind’s grip to loosen so that what has always been present reveals itself: not as an object, but as the open, luminous ground of all appearing.</p>
<p>This is why the path lies in the “field of Parvati.” She is the world not as illusion, but as play—the spontaneous expression of consciousness delighting in its own freedom. There is no need to transcend her; only to see her as she is: Bhairava’s own face, looking back through every sense, every moment, every breath.</p>

We mean the dynamism of consciousness <em>is</em> consciousness itself—just as the warmth of fire <em>is</em> fire, not something fire "has." Any distinction between Śiva and Śakti is a provisional map for minds still caught in duality.</p>
<p>The phrase "these distinctions are only the threshold for entry" is crucial. It does not mean spiritual practices are merely preliminary steps to discard later. It means every practice, every distinction, every method points beyond itself to what is already fully present. The threshold is not a barrier to cross, but a mirror to see through.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Extended Commentary</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>Don't think about fire—feel the warmth in your own hands right now. That heat is not separate from the life that generates it. Your awareness is not separate from its power to know. This is the living truth of non-duality: not a concept to understand, but a reality to recognize in this very instant.</p>
<p>The relationship between Śiva and Śakti has been misunderstood for centuries. It is not the dancer and the dance—it is dance itself appearing as both movement and stillness. When you walk, is your capacity to walk separate from you? When you see, is your seeing power different from your awareness? The division exists only in thought.</p>
<p>Every spiritual practice in the Vijñāna Bhairava is not a method to attain what you lack, but an invitation to recognize what you already are. When you attend to your breath, you are not "using" breath to reach awareness—you are allowing breath to reveal that you have never been separate from awareness. When you rest in the space between thoughts, you are not "preparing" for realization—you are noticing that realization was never absent.</p>
<p>This is why the text says these distinctions are "simply the threshold for entry." The threshold is not between you and truth; it is truth appearing as a doorway. The moment you step through, you discover you were already on the other side.</p>
<p>Consider how you know you exist. Is there a gap between your being and your knowing of being? Is your power to be aware somehow separate from your awareness? No—and yet the mind creates this separation to preserve itself. All spiritual methods exist only to collapse this artificial division.</p>
<p>The fire metaphor is not meant to explain, but to point. When you see a flame, do you experience heat and fire as two things? Or is there simply fire-heat, inseparable, self-evident? Your own nature is like this: not static being that somehow "has" dynamic power, but being-power as one indivisible reality.</p>
<p>The greatest trap in spirituality is mistaking the map for the territory, the practice for the realization. When you meditate on non-duality, you are not "practicing" to become non-dual—you are allowing the illusion of separation to reveal its own emptiness. There is no "you" that needs to merge with Śakti or Śiva—there is only the one reality temporarily appearing as someone seeking.</p>
<p>The yogi's aim is never moving toward unity, but stopping the movement of separation. In that stop, the question "Who am I?" dissolves not because it finds an answer, but because the questioner is seen as a ripple on the ocean of being. The wave doesn't need to reach the ocean—it is the ocean in motion.</p>
<p>Right now, as you read these words, feel the space between them. That space is not empty—it is full of awareness. That awareness is not yours; it is you. The power to know these words and the knower of these words are not two. They are the same reality appearing as both. This is not philosophy. It is what is happening in this very moment.</p>
<p>When all conceptual distinctions fall away, what remains is not a state to achieve, but the ground of all states. Not a goal to reach, but the space in which all goals appear and disappear. This is where Śakti and Śiva are not reconciled, but recognized as the one taste of reality—self-aware, self-sufficient, and ever free.</p>

<h3>Rest In Shakti Reveals Shiva</h3>

<div class="translation">
<p>When awareness rests in the state of Śakti—<br />
undivided, unbroken—<br />
in that very instant,<br />
you are Śiva himself.<br />
Śakti is not a doorway to cross,<br />
but the face of Śiva appearing as movement.<br />
Just as space is not created by light,<br />
but revealed by it—<br />
so, beloved, Śiva is not reached through Śakti—<br />
he is recognized as her very essence.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Lakshmanjoo's Transmission</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>Bhairava dismantles the subtle hierarchy that separates means from end, Śakti from Śiva. "Entering the state of Śakti" is not a journey from here to there; it is the surrender of the very notion that awareness could be fragmented or located. When attention abides without division (nirvibhāgena bhāvanā), there is no "you" who enters, no "state" to be entered—only the recognition that what appears as dynamic energy (śakti) and stillness (śiva) are one reality wearing two faces.</p>
<p>The phrase "in that very instant" (tadāiva) is crucial—it declares that realization is not the culmination of practice, but the collapse of the illusion that practice was ever needed. Śakti is called ‘the face of Śiva’ not because she is secondary, but because she is his very presence in motion. This is not metaphor. It is the living truth that the energy of your own breath, the pulsation in your veins, the clarity of your attention—these are not tools to reach Śiva. They are Śiva appearing as life itself.</p>
<p>The light analogy resolves the apparent paradox: just as a lamp does not create space but reveals what was always present, Śakti does not produce Śiva—she makes evident what never departed. Directions and spaces (dig-vibhāgādi) are not manufactured by illumination; they are recognized as they are. So too with Śiva: he is not attained through Śakti; he is recognized as the luminous ground in which Śakti dances.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Extended Commentary</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>Don't look for Śakti as a path to follow—feel her as the very aliveness in this breath right now. That tingling in your hands as you read these words, the space between your thoughts, the rhythm of your heartbeat—this is not a means to reach somewhere else. This is Śiva appearing as movement, as life, as you.</p>
<p>The greatest mistake in spirituality is treating Śakti as a ladder to climb rather than as the ground on which you stand. When you attend to your breath with total presence, you are not "using" breath to reach awareness—you are allowing breath to reveal that you have never been separate from awareness. The flame does not struggle to become light; it simply is light in motion. Your own nature is like this: not static being that somehow "has" dynamic power, but being-power as one indivisible reality.</p>
<p>This is why the text says "in that very instant, you are Śiva himself." The instant is not a moment in time—it is the timeless now where all striving collapses. When awareness rests without the subtle seeking that calls itself "spiritual practice," what remains is not a state to be achieved, but the ever-present ground of being that was never obscured. There is no "gateway" to cross because you were never outside.</p>
<p>Consider how space is known. Does a lamp create the room it illuminates? No—the room was always there, but in darkness, its dimensions remained unrecognized. Light does not manufacture space; it reveals space as it is. Similarly, Śakti does not create Śiva—she reveals him as the unchanging ground in which all change arises.</p>
<p>Every moment of your life offers this recognition. When joy surges through your body, don't call it "energy to be directed." Feel it as Śiva dancing as joy. When stillness settles in meditation, don't label it "a step toward realization." Recognize it as Śiva resting as stillness. The boundary between practice and realization is an illusion created by the mind seeking progress where none is needed.</p>
<p>The true meaning of "Śakti is the gateway to Śiva" is this: every pulse of life, every sensation, every breath is already a doorway—not because it leads somewhere, but because it reveals where you have always been. When you stop walking toward the door and recognize that you are standing in the temple, the journey and destination collapse into one taste.</p>
<p>Right now, as you read these words, feel the space in which they appear. That space is not empty—it is full of awareness. That awareness is not yours; it is you. The power to know these words and the knower of these words are not two. They are the same reality appearing as both. This is not philosophy. It is what is happening in this very moment.</p>
<p>The question "Who am I?" dissolves not because it finds an answer, but because the questioner is seen as a ripple on the ocean of being. The wave doesn't need to reach the ocean—it is the ocean in motion.</p>
<p>Thus, Śakti is not the path to truth—she is truth appearing as path. And every true practice is simply her invitation to stop seeking and rest where you already are: as the luminous space in which all experience arises, dances, and dissolves.</p>

</div>

<p class="center">Lakshmanjoo's Transmission</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>The Devī addresses Bhairava not merely as a deity, but as the embodiment of absolute freedom—trident-bearing (symbol of mastery over icchā, jñāna, and kriyā), skull-adorned (signifying transcendence of death and ego). She reiterates the paradox: the state to be realized is already full (bharitākārā), yet she asks for means (upāya). This is not contradiction, but pedagogy.</p>
<p>She acknowledges that this reality is “dik-deśa-kāla-śūnyā”—void of spatial, temporal, and conceptual boundaries—and “vyapadeśa-vivarjitā”—devoid of any description. And yet, for the mind still operating within duality, a point of entry is needed. Hence her question: if Parādevī is the entrance to Bhairava, how does that work? How can a doorway exist to that which is everywhere and nowhere?</p>
<p>The answer lies not in constructing a path, but in recognizing that every point of attention, when freed from grasping, is already the entrance. The upāyas are not methods to reach fullness, but invitations to notice that fullness is never absent.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Extended Commentary</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>The Devī’s question is the human condition distilled: How do I enter what cannot be entered? The state she describes is not a future achievement—it is the ever-present ground, “empty” of limitation, yet “full” beyond measure.</p>
<p>The trident and skulls are not ornamentation; they are symbols of radical freedom. The trident pierces the threefold bindings of time, space, and causality. The skulls declare the death of the egoic self that imagines it must go somewhere to become whole.</p>
<p>Her plea—“by what means?”—is honest. Even when one intellectually understands non-duality, the habit of seeking remains. The brilliance of the Vijñāna Bhairava is that it meets this impulse without rejection. Instead of saying “there is no path,” it offers 112 doorways—not to lead you to Bhairava, but to reveal that you are standing in him.</p>
<p>Parādevī as “mukha”—the face, the opening—is not a bridge to cross, but the very immediacy of perception. When you hear a sound without labeling it, when you feel the breath without controlling it, when you rest in the space between thoughts—that is her. She is not separate from the awareness in which all experience arises.</p>
<p>Thus, the question “how?” is answered not with a technique, but with a shift of identity: stop being the one who seeks the entrance, and recognize you are the openness in which the question itself appears.</p>

the true form of Bhairava<br />
is revealed through Bhairavī.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Lakshmanjoo's Transmission</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>In verse 24, the practitioner works with the natural rhythm of breath—prāṇa (outgoing) and jīva (incoming)—not as mechanical functions, but as manifestations of visarga, the subtle release of energy symbolized by the colon-like sound “ḥ.”  The 'two places of origin' are the heart—for the in-breath—and the point twelve finger-widths above the crown (<em>dvādaśānta</em>)—for the out-breath. By gently sustaining awareness at these points—without forcing or visualizing—one enters bharitā sthiti, the state of fullness. This method belongs to āṇavopāya, where attention operates through the body, breath, and mantra. The spontaneous arising of “so’ham” (“I am He”) reflects the natural resonance of identity with the absolute.</p>
<p>Verse 25 shifts to śāktopāya. Here, no mantra is recited, no focal point is imposed. Instead, one simply rests in the two “voids” (vyoma-yugma)—the subtle gaps at the end of exhalation and inhalation. These are not physical spaces, but moments of natural suspension where thought subsides and pure awareness shines. By returning again and again to these silent intervals—internally and externally—one does not “achieve” Bhairava; his form (vapuḥ) is unveiled through Bhairavī, who is none other than uninterrupted awareness itself. This is śāktopāya because the power of consciousness alone—without external support—reveals the truth.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Extended Commentary</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>These two verses present a seamless progression from embodied attention to pure awareness. In the first, breath is the vehicle; in the second, breath becomes the doorway to what lies beneath breath.</p>
<p>The “visarga” is key—it is not just a phonetic symbol, but the pulse of release that mirrors the cosmic rhythm of emanation and reabsorption. When one aligns with this subtle current—letting the out-breath rise as offering and the in-breath descend as reception—the duality of giving and receiving collapses into fullness (bharitā).</p>
<p>But fullness is not a sensation; it is the absence of lack. The “two places” are not locations in space, but thresholds of attention. The heart is where the self feels most intimate; the dvādaśānta is where individuality dissolves. Holding both is to dwell in the tensionless balance between immanence and transcendence.</p>
<p>Verse 25 goes further: drop even the breath. Attend only to the silence between breaths—the twin voids where no “me” exists to claim experience. These gaps are not empty; they are saturated with presence. It is here that Bhairavī—the dynamic face of awareness—reveals Bhairava, not as an object, but as the very ground of being.</p>
<p>No mantra, no ritual, no identity remains. Only this: the breath comes, the breath goes, and in the space between, everything is already whole.</p>

<h3>Centerless Center Of Thought-Free Being</h3>

<p>The breath-born energy<br />
neither flows out nor moves in—<br />
when, in the centerless center,<br />
thought-free being naturally unfolds.<br />
Right there—<br />
you are Bhairava.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Lakshmanjoo's Transmission</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>This verse marks the threshold where all technique dissolves into recognition. It is not about controlling the breath or finding a physical center in the body. "Madhye" is not a location to be discovered, but the immediacy of awareness before the mind divides experience into inside and outside.</p>
<p>When Śakti as breath (marud-rūpā) neither "goes" nor "enters," this is not a description of suspended respiration, but the collapse of the subtle seeker who tracks such movements. This cessation is not manufactured—it occurs when conceptualization itself dissolves.</p>
<p>"Nirvikalpatayā" is not the suppression of thought, but the natural clarity that appears when attention stops grasping at experience. It is not blankness, but fullness without reference points. When this thought-free stillness emerges—not as a state you achieve, but as the ground that was always here—the apparent journey into the center reveals itself as having never departed from wholeness.</p>
<p>This is śāmbhavopāya in its purest form: not a path to walk, but the recognition that walking and walker were never separate. Bhairava is not attained in this stillness—He is recognized as what has always been awake in the midst of all movement.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Extended Commentary</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>Most seekers misunderstand this verse immediately. They take "center" as a place to find inside the body, and "thought-free" as a state to manufacture. This creates tension—another form of seeking disguised as non-seeking. The true center is not found by looking inward, but by seeing through the illusion that awareness could ever be located anywhere.</p>
<p>Try this now: Don't try to stop your breath. Don't search for a center in your chest or head. Simply notice the space in which these words appear to you. That space is not empty—it is full of awareness. When thought subsides—not by force, but by the simple act of not feeding it—that same space reveals itself as centerless, boundless, and already complete.</p>
<p>This is the crucial distinction: manufactured stillness feels like suppression, effort, a holding back. Authentic stillness feels like relaxation—a letting go of the subtle tension that maintains the sense of being a separate observer. In manufactured stillness, you feel like "I am making my mind quiet." In authentic stillness, there is no "you" left to claim the quietness—it is simply the natural state when all conceptual overlay falls away.</p>
<p>Common pitfalls in this practice include:</p>
<pre><code>Mistaking the absence of gross thoughts for awakening, while subtle identification continues
Creating a subtle tension while trying to "be in the center"
Becoming frustrated when thoughts arise (not recognizing that the frustration itself is the contraction)
Searching for a special internal location rather than recognizing the immediacy of now
Confusing temporary mental blankness with the living fullness of awareness
</code></pre>
<p>The breath naturally settles not because you control it, but because the one who was controlling has vanished. This is not annihilation—it is liberation from the burden of being a separate entity trying to find itself. When that burden drops, what remains is not a state to be maintained, but the ever-present ground of being itself.</p>
<p>The phrase "you are Bhairava" is not a promise for the future. It is an invitation to recognize what is already true in this very moment. When you stop seeking a center, you discover you are the centerless presence in which all centers appear and dissolve. The breath flows or doesn't flow—but awareness remains untouched, unlocated, and free.</p>
<p>This is not a technique to master. It is the end of technique. Not a state to achieve, but the recognition of what never departed. In that recognition, there is no "one" who becomes Bhairava—only Bhairava appearing as the space in which all apparent separation collapses into the one taste of reality.</p>

<h3>Peace Arising In The Pause</h3>

<div class="translation">
<p>When the breath is held—<br />
after exhaling, after inhaling,<br />
or filled to its fullness—<br />
then, at the culmination of that pause,<br />
the peaceful state, whose name is Śānta,<br />
shines forth through Śakti.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Lakshmanjoo's Transmission</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>This verse describes a regulated practice involving kumbhaka—the gentle retention of breath either after exhalation (recitā), after inhalation (pūritā), or in natural fullness (kumbhitā). The key is effortlessness: the hold should not be forced, but sustained only as long as it remains comfortable. The focus is not duration, but the quality of stillness that arises in the pause.</p>
<p>At the end of such retention (tadante), the mind naturally settles, and the state known as Śānta—the essence of Sadāśiva—reveals itself. Śānta here signifies the appeased, undisturbed ground of consciousness, free from the turbulence of thought and sensation. This revelation occurs “through Śakti” (śaktyā), meaning it is not achieved by will alone, but by the grace of the energy that animates breath itself.</p>
<p>This method belongs initially to āṇavopāya, as it involves bodily discipline and mental focus. But as the pauses deepen and the mind subsides, it effortlessly transitions into śāktopāya—the domain of pure awareness. The state that dawns is not foreign; it is Bhairava himself in his embodied aspect as Sadāśiva, fully present yet utterly at peace.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Extended Commentary</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>Verse 27 offers a bridge between effort and effortlessness. The practice of kumbhaka is not about control, but about creating a momentary gap in the habitual flow of mental activity. In that gap—however brief—the automatic identification with body and mind softens, and something deeper surfaces: the stillness that underlies all movement.</p>
<p>The “peaceful state” (śānta) is not a mood or temporary calm. It is the unshaken nature of awareness, often symbolized as Sadāśiva—the form of Śiva fully integrated with Śakti, abiding in the world without being bound by it. This is Bhairava not as a distant ideal, but as the silent presence within embodiment.</p>
<p>Crucially, the text specifies that this state “shines forth through Śakti.” The energy of breath is not merely a tool; it is the very medium of revelation. When breath is gently paused, the outward rush of attention reverses, and awareness turns inward—not as an act of introspection, but as a natural settling.</p>
<p>This practice is not ascetic. It asks for only a few seconds of mindful retention, repeated with ease. Over time, the pauses become less about breath and more about presence. The goal is not to perfect retention, but to discover that what is revealed in the pause was never absent—only overlooked.</p>
<p>Thus, what begins as discipline (āṇavopāya) ripens into recognition (śāktopāya), and in that recognition, the practitioner does not “attain” peace—peace is seen to be the ever-present ground of all experience.</p>

shimmering from the root—<br />
subtle, growing subtler—<br />
until, at the culmination of twelve spans,<br />

There, in that settling,<br />
Bhairava is recognized.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Lakshmanjoo's Transmission</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>This verse is not about moving energy upward through physical spaces. The "luminous energy" (kiraṇābhāsāṃ) is not a substance to be manipulated, but the natural radiance of awareness itself when attention withdraws from external fixation. "Mūlādhāra" is not a location in the perineum, but the ground of ordinary, embodied experience—the place where consciousness most intimately touches form.</p>
<p>The phrase "sūkṣmat sūkṣmatarātmikām" (subtle, growing subtler) describes not physical movement but the progressive refinement of perception. As the mind settles, the gross identification with body, emotions, and thoughts dissolves into finer and finer layers of awareness—until even the sense of "rising" collapses into its source.</p>
<p>"Dvi-ṣaṭkānte" (at the end of the twelve spans) is not a measurement in space, but the completion of attention's journey inward—a symbolic threshold where all reference points vanish. When this energy settles into stillness (saṃyāntīṃ), it is not an achievement, but the recognition that consciousness was never actually moving—it only seemed so through the lens of duality.</p>
<p>In that stillness, "Bhairava is recognized" (bhairavodayaḥ)—not as a new experience, but as what has always been awake beneath all movement. This is not śāktopāya becoming śāmbhavopāya; it is the immediate recognition that both were always one.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Extended Commentary</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>Don't think about energy rising—feel the space in which this text appears to you right now. That space is not empty; it is full of awareness. That awareness is what the verse calls "luminous energy." It is not something to move. It is what is already present, though overlooked.</p>
<p>The metaphor of rising is not literal instruction. It is a gesture pointing to the natural movement of attention when it stops chasing external objects and turns toward its source. Like a homing pigeon finding its way home, awareness naturally settles—not by traveling, but by ceasing to wander.</p>
<p>The "twelve spans" (dvi-ṣaṭkānte) is not a physical measurement. It is the symbolic completion of letting go of all reference points—inside and outside, up and down, sacred and profane. When this letting go is total, what remains is not a state to achieve, but the ever-present ground of being that was never absent.</p>
<p>This is where most seekers get trapped. They take the metaphor of rising as instruction and create tension in the name of "spiritual progress." They become frustrated when they don't feel energy moving up their spine, or when they don't experience dramatic states at the crown. This is the subtle suffering created by mistaking the finger for the moon.</p>
<p>Bhairava's awakening is not a future event. It is the collapse of the illusion that you were ever separate from what you seek. When the mind stops chasing the next experience and simply rests as it is—a thought, a breath, a sensation appearing in open awareness—that is Bhairava dawning.</p>
<p>Try this now: read these words without trying to understand them conceptually. Feel the space between them. Feel the awareness that knows these words. That space, that awareness—this is not preliminary. This is Bhairava himself, appearing as the very act of reading.</p>
<p>The "luminous energy" is not hidden in your spine. It is the aliveness in your own hand as you hold this text. The "twelve spans" are not measured in finger-widths but in moments of presence. When you stop counting these moments and simply rest in one of them—fully, without seeking the next—that is where Bhairava is recognized.</p>
<p>The ordinary becomes sacred not because it changes, but because your attention changes. When you walk after reading this, don't look for energy in your spine. Feel the space in which your foot touches the ground. That space is not below you—it is what you are. The flame of consciousness is not climbing toward some distant crown—it is already burning brightly in the simple act of being here, now, awake.</p>
<p>Thus, the rising flame is not a path to travel but a mirror to see through. And in that seeing, there is no journey left—only the unbroken wholeness that is Bhairava.</p>

<h3>Shakti Rising Like Lightning</h3>

<p class="sanskrit-block">
उद्गच्छन्तीं तडिद्रूपां प्रतिचक्रं क्रमात्क्रमम्।<br>
ऊर्ध्वं मुष्टित्रयं यावत्तावदन्ते महोदयः॥२९॥<br>

ūrdhvaṃ muṣṭi-trayaṃ yāvat tāvad-ante mahodayaḥ ||29||<br>
</p>

<div class="translation">
<p>Meditate on Śakti rising like lightning—<br />
illuminating cakra after cakra without pause,<br />
ascending through the span of three fists,<br />
until, in that very culmination, the Great Awakening dawns.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Lakshmanjoo's Transmission</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>This verse presents the lightning path not as sequential attainment but as instantaneous revelation wearing the garment of progression. The "rising" is not movement through space but the collapse of all spatial reference in a single flash of recognition. When awareness is utterly present—free from the subtle seeking that calls itself "spiritual practice"—Śakti reveals herself not as energy ascending, but as the luminous space in which all apparent movement occurs.</p>
<p>The "three fists" is not measurement but metaphor: the entire spectrum of embodied experience—from root to crown—is traversed not by effort but by the sudden cessation of contraction. This is neither āṇavopāya nor śāktopāya in their conventional forms, but śāmbhavopāya disguised as method: the moment the practitioner stops chasing the lightning and becomes the sky in which it flashes, all cakras simultaneously blaze as one reality.</p>
<p>The "Great Awakening" (mahodayaḥ) is not reached at the crown—it is recognized as what has always been awake, before the first flicker of "rise" appeared. The path is progressive only to the mind still bound by time; to awareness itself, the journey and destination are one taste.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Extended Commentary</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>Lightning does not "travel" from cloud to earth—it simply is, illuminating the entire space between in one undivided instant. So too with awakening: the apparent progression through cakras is merely the mind's attempt to map the unmappable. In truth, when Śakti flashes as lightning, all centers blaze simultaneously, not as sequential stations but as facets of one diamond.</p>
<p>The cakras are not locations to reach but contractions to recognize: each is a knot of "I am this" that tightens around awareness. When lightning strikes, these knots don't unravel one by one—they dissolve in the recognition that the space between knots was always the sky itself. The "three fists" (muṣṭi-trayam) is the full span of human experience, from the deepest grounding to the highest expansion—collapsed into a single flash where inside and outside vanish.</p>

<h3>The Twelvefold Sequence</h3>

<div class="translation">
<p>Through the twelvefold sequence,<br />
each aligned with a primal sound,<br />
abide in their gross, subtle, and supreme modes—<br />
then, leaving each behind in turn,<br />
Śiva alone remains.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Lakshmanjoo's Transmission</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>This verse outlines a structured ascent through twelve subtle stations (krama-dvādaśakam), each corresponding to one of the twelve primary vowels (from <em>a</em> to <em>aḥ</em>, excluding the vocalic liquids <em>ṛ, ṝ, ḷ, ḹ</em>). The stations—janmāgra (perineum), mūla, kaṇḍa, nābhi (navel), hṛt (heart), kaṇṭha (throat), tālu (palate), bhrūmadhya (between the brows), lalāṭa (forehead), brahma-randhra (crown aperture), śakti (the power that pierces the aperture), and vyāpinī (the all-pervading ether)—represent progressive refinements of awareness.</p>
<p>The practitioner engages each center in three stages of perception:<br />
- <strong>Sthūla</strong> (gross): through focused visualization and mantra repetition (e.g., <em>a</em> at janmāgra),<br />
- <strong>Sūkṣma</strong> (subtle): through <em>spanda-manatā</em>—the palpable vibration or throb of consciousness pervading the body,<br />
- <strong>Parā</strong> (supreme): through <em>jyoti-rūpatā</em>—dissolving even the sense of vibration into the luminous fire of pure awareness.</p>
<p>At each stage, one “leaves” (<em>muktvā</em>) the prior mode—not by rejection, but by natural transcendence as attention deepens. This is <em>laya-cintanā</em>: absorption through successive refinement. The culmination—<em>antataḥ śivaḥ</em>—is not arrival at a new state, but the collapse of all intermediary layers into the sole reality of Śiva. Though framed as āṇavopāya due to its sequential nature, it ripens into śāktopāya and ultimately śāmbhavopāya as effort gives way to spontaneous recognition.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Extended Commentary</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>This method is a map of interiority—not of the physical body, but of consciousness contracting and expanding through layers of self-identification. The twelve vowels are not phonetic symbols alone; they are seed-resonances of awareness itself. To “recite <em>a</em> at janmāgra” is not mere lip movement—it is aligning attention with the primal openness from which all form emerges.</p>
<p>The progression from <em>sthūla</em> to <em>parā</em> mirrors the maturation of meditation:<br />
- <strong>Gross (sthūla)</strong>: attention is tethered to form—breath, image, sound.<br />
- <strong>Subtle (sūkṣma)</strong>: the body becomes a field of vibration—no longer solid, but humming with aliveness. Breath may shorten, not by force, but because awareness no longer leaks outward.<br />
- <strong>Supreme (parā)</strong>: even vibration subsides into luminous stillness—the “fire of realization” (<em>jyoti</em>) that consumes all duality.</p>
<p>The instruction to “leave each behind” (<em>muktvā muktvā</em>) is essential. One does not cling to the bliss of the heart or the clarity of the third eye. Each station is a stepping-stone, not a destination. The final “leaving” is the dissolution of the meditator himself.</p>
<p>Importantly, this path confirms that awakening does not require dramatic kuṇḍalinī experiences. Realization can dawn in stillness, even without “rising” through centers—because what is realized was never located <em>anywhere</em>. The twelvefold sequence is a skillful means to exhaust the mind’s habit of grasping, so that, in the end, only Śiva—the ever-present, unconstructed ground—shines forth.</p>

<h3>Brow Concentration</h3>

<p class="sanskrit-block">
तयाध्पूर्यासु मूर्धान्तं भङ्क्त्वा भ्रूक्षेपसेतुना।<br>

<div class="translation">
<p>With that same breath-energy,<br />
fill the body up to the crown—<br />
then, using the bridge formed by the raised brows,<br />
halt its movement.<br />
Rendering the mind utterly thought-free,<br />
in the supreme height,<br />
all-pervasiveness dawns.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Lakshmanjoo's Transmission</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>This practice belongs to āṇavopāya, yet it is direct and non-sequential. One uses the natural flow of prāṇa—not through retention (kumbhaka), but through one-pointed focus at bhrūmadhya, the space between the eyebrows. This focus acts as a <em>setu</em>—a bridge or dam—that spontaneously suspends the breath’s movement, not by physical constriction, but by the intensity of concentration.</p>
<p>As the breath fills the body up to <em>mūrdhānta</em> (the crown, or brahma-randhra), and is then “broken” (<em>bhaṅktvā</em>) by the inner seal of brow-concentration, the mind naturally settles into <em>nirvikalpa</em>—freedom from conceptualization. In that stillness, the practitioner does not “attain” all-pervasiveness; rather, the illusion of limitation dissolves, revealing the inherent state of <em>sarva-godgamaḥ</em>—the rising of universal awareness in the highest (sarvordhve).</p>
<p>Though breath is involved, this is not mechanical prāṇāyāma. The suspension arises not from willful holding, but from the mind’s absorption so complete that breath, thought, and sense of self vanish together.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Extended Commentary</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>Verse 31 offers a swift path: not through stages, but through vertical alignment. The “filling” of the body is not inflation, but the expansion of attention—awareness spreading from root to crown like light flooding a room. The “bridge of the brows” (<em>bhrū-kṣepa-setu</em>) is not a physical gesture, but the inner act of gathering attention into a single point. In that focus, breath halts—not because it is stopped, but because the outward impulse of consciousness reverses.</p>
<p>This is a crucial distinction: in kumbhaka, one controls breath; here, breath surrenders to awareness. The result is <em>nirvikalpa</em>—not blankness, but the luminous absence of mental division. In that clarity, the sense of being a localized entity collapses, and what remains is <em>sarva-godgamaḥ</em>: the spontaneous upsurge of boundless being.</p>
<p>Though classified as āṇavopāya due to the initial use of breath and focus, the moment thought ceases and breath suspends by itself, the method transcends technique. The “highest state” (<em>sarvordhve</em>) is not above the head—it is the non-local reality in which head, body, and world appear.</p>
<p>Thus, this verse is not an instruction to “do” something, but an invitation to discover what happens when attention is so utterly gathered that the mind forgets itself—and in that forgetting, everything is remembered.</p>

<h3>Five Sensory Fields</h3>

<div class="translation">
<p>Meditate on the five sensory fields—<br />
not as solid objects,<br />
but as luminous emptiness—<br />
vibrant with the manifold colors<br />
of a peacock's shimmering display.<br />
In that seeing-through,<br />
you enter the Heart:<br />
the supreme fullness beyond all limit.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Lakshmanjoo's Transmission</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>The 'five voids' (śūnya-pañcakam) are not objects to visualize, but the transparent nature of sensory experience itself. When you see color, hear sound, feel texture—what is actually present is not a separate "object," but awareness appearing as sensation. Like a peacock's feather, every perception shimmers with vividness while revealing its empty core: the color has no color outside seeing; the sound has no sound outside hearing.</p>
<p>This is not withdrawal from the world, but radical intimacy with it. There is no "meditation on voids" as a separate practice from life—there is only seeing through the illusion of solidity in each moment of ordinary perception. When this recognition arises—not as concept but as lived reality—the apparent boundary between "within" and "beyond" dissolves, and what was called "Heart" (hṛdaya) reveals itself not as a destination to reach, but as the ever-present ground of all experience.</p>
<p>This is śāktopāya in its purest form: not a technique to master, but the collapse of the illusion that awareness could ever be separate from its own expressions.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Extended Commentary</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>Don't think about peacock feathers—look at your own hand right now. See its form, its texture, its color. Now look deeper. That "solidity" you perceive is not a thing "out there"—it is a shimmering field of sensation appearing within awareness itself. The red of an apple, the sound of traffic, the taste of tea—none exist independently of the awareness that knows them. They are not illusions to be dismissed, but transparent expressions of consciousness itself.</p>
<p>The paradox dissolves when understood correctly: you are not "meditating on voids" as a special practice apart from ordinary life. You are recognizing that ordinary life is already void of separate existence. The peacock's feather is not a metaphor—it is a mirror. Its iridescent beauty appears vivid and real, yet contains no substance that can be isolated or possessed. So too with all sensory experience: the world shines brilliantly, yet remains transparent to the awareness that illuminates it.</p>
<p>Most paths teach you to withdraw from sensory experience or control it through technique. This path invites you to engage fully while seeing through. There is no need to "draw out" or "withdraw"—simply be utterly present with whatever appears, without the subtle contraction that says "this is happening to me." When you stop reinforcing the illusion of separation, what remains is not absence, but the fullness of awareness recognizing itself in all its expressions.</p>
<p>This is not a practice for the meditation cushion alone. It is recognition in the marketplace. When you hear a child's laughter, don't merely experience joy—see through the joy to the awareness that holds it. When you taste food, don't just enjoy the flavor—recognize the space in which flavor appears. This is not dual attention; it is unified seeing.</p>
<p>The "five voids" are not five separate spaces to contemplate, but the single space of awareness appearing as five modes of perception. When recognition is total—not as intellectual understanding, but as the collapse of subject-object duality—the Heart (hṛdaya) is not entered. It is recognized as what has never been departed from.</p>
<p>Try this now: read these words without trying to conceptualize them. Feel the space between them. That space is not empty—it is full of awareness. That awareness is not yours; it is you. The five senses are not windows to a world "out there"—they are expressions of the one reality dancing as multiplicity. In that recognition, there is no path to follow, no void to meditate on, no Heart to enter. There is only this: awareness, already whole, already free, already home.</p>
<p>The peacock's feather does not need to be contemplated—it needs to be seen. And in that seeing, the rainbow dissolves into light, the senses dissolve into awareness, and what remains is not emptiness as absence, but the unbroken wholeness that is Bhairava—shining as this very moment, this very breath, this very recognition.</p>

</div>

<p class="center">Lakshmanjoo's Transmission</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>Verse 33 reveals the universality of śāktopāya: the object of concentration is immaterial. Whether one rests attention on the sky’s emptiness (<em>śūnya</em>), a blank wall (<em>kuḍya</em>), or the heart of a devoted disciple (<em>pare pātre</em>), the point is not the object, but the unwavering focus itself. In that one-pointedness (<em>cintanā</em>), the mind’s habitual scattering ceases, and awareness naturally subsides into its source. This self-dissolution (<em>svayam līnā</em>) is not loss, but awakening—and from that stillness, grace (<em>varapradā</em>) spontaneously flows, blessing both practitioner and environment.</p>
<p>Verse 34 offers a more defined support: the inner vault of the skull (<em>kapālāntar</em>). This is not mere anatomical focus; it is the symbolic abode of pure consciousness—the space where thought arises and vanishes. With eyes closed (<em>milita-locanaḥ</em>) and body still (<em>tiṣṭhan</em>), the practitioner stabilizes the mind within this luminous void. Through sustained presence (<em>krameṇa manaso dāṛhyāt</em>), the distinction between observer and observed fades, and the “supreme aim” (<em>lakṣyam uttamam</em>)—Śiva as non-dual awareness—shines forth not as an object, but as the very ground of seeing.</p>
<p>Both practices are śāktopāya: they rely not on breath or mantra, but on the power of focused awareness alone.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Extended Commentary</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>Verse 33 demolishes the myth that spiritual practice requires special conditions. Grace is not reserved for temples or mountaintops—it awakens wherever attention becomes total. The wall, the sky, the disciple: none are sacred in themselves. What matters is the intensity of presence. When the mind fixes without distraction, the boundary between “inside” and “outside” softens, and awareness recognizes its own infinity. The “dissolving” (<em>līnā</em>) is the collapse of subject-object duality; the “boon” (<em>vara</em>) is the return to native freedom.</p>
<p>Verse 34 turns inward, not to escape the world, but to find its source. The skull’s interior is not bone, but boundless space—the same emptiness that holds galaxies. To rest there is to abide at the threshold of emanation, where thought is born as light, not as noise. The “fire” sometimes described is not heat, but the self-luminosity of consciousness—<em>cit-prakāśa</em>—which needs no fuel.</p>
<p>Gradual firmness (<em>krameṇa dāṛhyāt</em>) does not mean slow progress, but deepening steadiness. As agitation settles, what remains is not a “state” to be achieved, but the ever-present <em>lakṣyam uttamam</em>: the untargeted target, the unseen seer, the silent witness that is Bhairava himself.</p>
<p>In both verses, the method is simple: attend fully. The rest is revelation.</p>
<p>The peacock's feather does not need to be contemplated—it needs to be seen. And in that seeing, the rainbow dissolves into light, the senses dissolve into awareness, and what remains is not emptiness as absence, but the unbroken wholeness that is Bhairava—shining as this very moment, this very breath, this very recognition that needs no form and fears no form.</p>

<h3>Central Channel As The Inner Sky</h3>

<div class="translation">
<p>The central channel, abiding at the core,<br />
is subtle as the fiber of a lotus stalk.<br />
Meditated upon through the Goddess<br />
who is the inner sky,<br />
the Divine reveals himself.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Lakshmanjoo's Transmission</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>The <em>madhya-nāḍī</em>—Suṣumnā—is not a physical channel nor a mental construct, but the self-luminous axis of pure subjectivity, the thread of awareness along which consciousness recognizes its own nature. Its subtlety is likened to the innermost fiber of a lotus stalk (<em>bīsa-sūtrābharipayā</em>): so fine it cannot be grasped by thought or sensation, existing beyond both the objective and conceptual fields.</p>
<p>To “meditate” on it is not to visualize or manipulate, but to rest in the space it signifies—the inner void (<em>antar-vyoma</em>) that is none other than <em>devyā</em>, the Goddess as unbounded awareness. This is not a practice performed <em>by</em> the individual mind; it is the channel itself that “meditates,” meaning awareness returns to its source through its own inherent intelligence.</p>
<p>Thus, the Divine (<em>devaḥ</em>)—Bhairava—is not seen <em>by</em> the practitioner, but <em>as</em> the unbroken clarity in which the sense of practitioner has vanished. This is pure śāmbhavopāya: the direct path of instantaneous recognition, where means and end, meditator and meditation, dissolve into one seamless reality.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Extended Commentary</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>This verse marks the threshold where method disappears into immediacy. The ‘central channel’ is not inside your body—it is the bodyless dimension of awareness that makes embodiment possible. The lotus-fiber analogy is precise: just as the fiber is invisible to the naked eye yet holds the stalk together, so Suṣumnā is the unseen coherence of all experience.</p>
<p>The phrase “meditated upon through the Goddess who is the inner sky” (<em>antar-vyomayā devyā</em>) is key. The Goddess is not an entity, but the open, luminous quality of attention itself—the space in which thoughts, sensations, and perceptions come and go. To “meditate” here is not an act, but a yielding: allowing awareness to settle into its natural condition, free from direction or effort.</p>
<p>There is no “doing” in this practice. The individual mind cannot reach Suṣumnā, because the mind is a ripple <em>on</em> that channel, not the channel itself. Realization occurs not when you arrive, but when the illusion of having left collapses.</p>
<p>This is śāmbhavopāya in its purest form: no breath, no mantra, no object—not even the subtlest support. Only the silent recognition that what you are seeking is already fully present as the space in which the seeking arises. In that recognition, the Divine does not “appear”—He is seen to have never been absent.</p>

</div>

<p class="center">Lakshmanjoo's Transmission</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>This verse presents not a technique to master, but an invitation to recognize what is already present. The hands covering the eyes is not a method to create stillness, but a gesture of surrender—a symbolic closing of the gates through which the mind habitually escapes into the world. The true focus is not on the brow center as a location, but on the inner space where thought naturally subsides.</p>
<p>The luminous bindu is not a vision to be sought, but the mind's final contraction before it recognizes its own nature. Its apparent "dissolution" is not an event in time, but the collapse of the very notion that awareness could be confined to form. This is not a gradual process requiring effort; it is the natural clarity that appears when attention stops chasing objects.</p>
<p>In that instant of recognition—when there is no "me" seeing a bindu, no bindu to be seen—what remains is not a state to be attained, but Bhairava's ever-present nature, shining as the silent ground beneath all experience. The "supreme state" is not reached through the technique; the technique reveals that we never departed from it.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Extended Commentary</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>The dissolving bindu is not a spiritual experience, but the end of spiritual seeking. When you cover your eyes with your palms, you are not creating darkness—you are removing the distraction of form so that what has always been luminous can be recognized. The space between the brows is not a point in the body, but the threshold where the mind surrenders its obsession with inside and outside.</p>
<p>The bindu that appears is the mind's final stronghold—the last vestige of "I am here, looking at that." Its dissolution is not something you do; it is what happens when you stop doing. Like a wave realizing it was never separate from the ocean, the bindu doesn't "fade" into anything—it simply reveals its true nature as the boundless space in which it appeared.</p>
<p>This practice is not about achieving samādhi. It is about seeing through the illusion that you were ever apart from it. When the eyes are covered and attention rests in the inner space, the question "Who is aware?" naturally arises—not as an intellectual puzzle, but as a direct invitation to look. In that looking, the seeker and the sought collapse into one taste.</p>
<p>The "centerless center" where the supreme state reveals itself is not a location to find, but the living reality you already are. The hands that cover the eyes, the bindu that appears and vanishes, the stillness that remains—all are expressions of the same consciousness that was never bound or liberated. What we call "technique" is merely the unraveling of our resistance to what has always been whole.</p>
<p>The world is not denied—ears still hear sounds, breath still flows—but nothing can touch the silent ground in which all appearances dance. The bindu dissolves not because we make it vanish, but because we finally recognize it as our own face, looking back through every sense.</p>

</div>

<p class="center">Lakshmanjoo's Transmission</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>This practice begins with a physical gesture: lightly agitating the pupils (<em>dhāma</em>) by applying gentle pressure with the fingers. This is not forceful, but a subtle stimulation that triggers an inner luminous response—a fine, flame-like point (<em>sūkṣmāgni-tilakākṛtim</em>) appearing in the visual field. This is the <em>bindu</em>, the concentrated essence of awareness made visible through sensory perturbation.</p>
<p>The practitioner then holds this bindu simultaneously in two places: <em>sikhānte</em> (the tip of the tuft, i.e., ūrdhva-dvādaśānta—twelve finger-widths above the crown) and <em>hṛdaye</em> (the heart center, the space between the in- and out-breaths). This dual focus bridges the highest and innermost dimensions of being. As concentration deepens, the bindu is no longer “seen”—it dissolves, and with it, the sense of meditator. In that dissolution (<em>laya</em>), one merges with Śiva, not as an event, but as the recognition of innate unity.</p>
<p>Though initiated through bodily action—hence classified as āṇavopāya—the moment attention stabilizes on the bindu, the method transitions into śāktopāya, where awareness alone sustains the process.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Extended Commentary</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>The “agitation” of the eye is not random; it is a skillful disruption of ordinary perception, creating a crack through which inner light enters awareness. The resulting <em>bindu</em> is not a hallucination, but the mind’s first glimpse of its own luminosity—compact, undivided, and self-revealing.</p>
<p>Holding it at both crown and heart is symbolic of integrating transcendence and immanence. The crown is where formless awareness opens into infinity; the heart is where it pulses as intimate presence. To rest in both simultaneously is to live the non-dual truth: the absolute is not “above”—it is the core of this very moment.</p>
<p>The word <em>laya</em> is often translated as “absorption,” but it is more precisely “dissolution into the source.” It does not imply loss of awareness; rather, the contraction of selfhood relaxes, and what remains is awareness without center or boundary.</p>
<p>This verse acknowledges that awakening can be sparked by the body—not as an obstacle, but as a threshold. The eye, the flame, the breath, the heart: all are portals. The practice ends not when the bindu fades, but when the one who watched it vanishes—and only light remains, shining as it always has.</p>

<h3>The Unstruck Inner Sound</h3>

<div class="translation">
<p>One who is immersed in the unstruck sound—<br />
heard within the folded ear,<br />
unbroken as a rushing river—<br />
attains the supreme Brahman.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Lakshmanjoo's Transmission</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>The “unstruck sound” (<em>anāhata</em>) is not produced by any physical collision; it is the spontaneous vibration of consciousness itself, perceived when external noise is set aside. The phrase <em>patra-karṇe</em>—“in the ear shaped like a leaf”—refers to the natural cupping of the hand over the ear, not to block sound, but to turn attention inward, where the inner resonance becomes audible.</p>
<p>This sound may also be approached through external analogues: the ceaseless rush of a waterfall (<em>sarid-drute</em>), the hum of wind, or any continuous, undivided tone. The key is not the source, but the unbroken quality of the sound—<em>bhagna-śabde</em>, “unfractured,” without gaps or interruption.</p>
<p>To be “immersed” (<em>niṣṇātaḥ</em>) in <em>śabda-brahman</em>—the Sound that is Brahman—is not passive listening, but total absorption. In that immersion, the boundary between listener and sound dissolves, and one realizes that the vibration is none other than the self-luminous ground of all being. This is śāktopāya: awareness resting in the flow of sound, without mantra, breath control, or ritual—only pure listening.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Extended Commentary</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>Verse 38 offers one of the most accessible gateways to non-dual recognition: sound. Unlike light or breath, sound requires no special posture or inner visualization—it is always already present. The “unstruck” sound is not mystical; it is the subtle hum beneath silence, the ever-present resonance of existence.</p>
<p>Cupping the hands over the ears is not to create sound, but to withdraw from external distraction so the inner vibration—<em>anāhata nāda</em>—can be heard. Yet even an external sound like a river’s flow can serve, provided attention remains unwavering. The unbroken continuity (<em>bhagna-śabde</em>) mirrors the uninterrupted nature of awareness itself.</p>
<p>To “bathe” in this sound (<em>niṣṇātaḥ</em>) is to let it permeate every layer of identity until the listener vanishes into the listening. In that moment, sound is no longer “heard”—it is recognized as the very texture of reality. The distinction between <em>śabda-brahman</em> (sound as manifestation) and <em>para-brahman</em> (the absolute) collapses, for the vibration and the silence from which it arises are one.</p>
<p>This practice reveals a profound truth: liberation is not found by silencing the world, but by hearing it so completely that the one who hears disappears—and only the eternal resonance remains.</p>

<h3>Mantra's Silent Resonance</h3>

<p class="sanskrit-block">

<div class="translation">
<p>O Bhairavī,<br />
by intoning the primal syllable—<br />
prolonged until it fades—<br />
and resting in the silence that follows,<br />
you enter boundless emptiness<br />
through the Supreme Power of the Void.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Lakshmanjoo's Transmission</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>This practice begins with the utterance of a sacred syllable—<em>praṇava</em>—such as <em>oṃ</em>, <em>hūṃ</em>, or <em>hrīṃ</em>, each representing a dimension of reality: Vedic unity, Śiva’s transformative power, or the dynamic matrix of manifestation. The key is not the syllable itself, but how it is sounded: <em>plutānte</em>, extended in a slow, resonant outflow (three or more mātrās), allowing the vibration to fill awareness fully.</p>
<p>At the moment the sound dissolves into silence, the practitioner does not chase the echo or anticipate the next repetition. Instead, one rests precisely in the gap—<em>śūnya-bhāvanāt</em>, contemplation of the void where sound returns to its source. This is not absence, but the luminous stillness from which all vibration arises.</p>
<p>Through this supreme Śakti of emptiness (<em>śūnyayā parayā śaktyā</em>), Bhairavī—the awakened feminine power—merges into <em>śūnyatā</em>, the boundless openness that is Bhairava’s true nature. Though the method starts with vocalization (āṇavopāya), its essence lies in śāktopāya: the direct recognition of awareness in the silence between sounds.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Extended Commentary</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>The prolonged sounding of <em>praṇava</em> is not ritual; it is a means to saturate the mind with vibration so that, when it ceases, the contrast reveals the ground beneath all resonance. The “void” at the end is not empty space—it is the unconditioned awareness that was never disturbed by the sound to begin with.</p>
<p>This verse subtly inverts expectation: one does not meditate <em>on</em> the mantra, but <em>after</em> it. The sacred syllable serves only to create a clean edge between noise and silence. In that edge, the sense of “I” that speaks or listens evaporates, and what remains is pure listening—unlocated, unowned, self-aware.</p>
<p>The phrase “Supreme Power of the Void” (<em>śūnyayā parayā śaktyā</em>) is vital. Emptiness here is not passive; it is the dynamic source of all manifestation. To “enter” it is not to go anywhere, but to realize that one has never left it. Every sound arises within it, every thought floats on it, every breath moves through it.</p>
<p>Thus, this practice is both simple and complete: sound a syllable fully, let it go completely, and abide in what remains. In that abidance, Bhairavī does not “attain” Bhairava—she recognizes herself as his very essence: open, radiant, and free.</p>

<h3>Openness Before And After Sound</h3>

<div class="translation">
<p>Attend to the edge before any sound,<br />
and the edge after it ends—<br />
and, awestruck by the boundless openness,<br />
become that openness itself.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Lakshmanjoo's Transmission</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>This is pure śāmbhavopāya—the highest means, where even the subtlety of sound is abandoned for the immediacy of pre- and post-utterance silence. One does not meditate on a mantra, but on the two thresholds surrounding it: pūrvāntau—the moment just before sound arises, and the moment just after it dissolves.</p>
<p>Crucially, these are not two separate moments, but a single threshold where awareness stands before all manifestation. In that pre-utterance moment, there is no syllable, only pure potential—icchā-prasara, the unconditioned impulse of consciousness before it takes form as sound. In the post-utterance, there is no echo, only the open space into which sound has returned. To "attend" (anubhāvayet) is not to conceptualize, but to rest in the naked awareness that holds both moments as one.</p>
<p>Through this, one is "awed by the void" (śūnya-bhītaḥ)—not with fear, but with reverence at the boundless openness that precedes and follows all manifestation. In that awe, the practitioner (pumān) does not attain voidness; his very form (ākāra) becomes voidness (śūnyākāraḥ)—not as negation, but as the luminous, unconditioned nature of Bhairava.</p>
<p>Though Śakti is the medium—śūnyayā, "by the power of the void"—the realization is Śiva. Even in śāmbhavopāya, it is Śakti who reveals, for she is the dynamic face of the absolute.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Extended Commentary</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>This verse distills meditation to its essence: attention to the edges of experience. The "beginning" of a sound is not merely a point in time—it is the silent potential from which all expression springs. The "end" is not cessation—it is the return to source. Between them, sound is merely the ripple; outside them, the ocean.</p>
<p>This practice requires no special mantra. Any syllable will do—oṃ, sauḥ, even a whispered "ah." What matters is the pause before and after. In the first, awareness is poised like an archer's bow; in the second, it is released into stillness. To dwell in both is to live at the threshold of creation and dissolution.</p>
<p>"Becoming the void" is not annihilation. It is the collapse of the illusion that one is separate from the ground of being. The "form of voidness" (śūnyākāraḥ) is not a blank state, but the fully embodied presence that shines when all self-contraction ceases.</p>
<p>Most crucially, this is not confined to formal meditation. It functions in ordinary life: in the space between words in conversation, the pause before responding to a text message, the breath before answering a question. These moments are not interruptions to life—they are life itself in its unadorned immediacy. The mother holding her crying baby, the CEO before a critical decision, the artist between brushstrokes—all stand at these thresholds. The practice is not to withdraw from speech and activity, but to recognize the silence that underlies them.</p>
<p>This is śāmbhavopāya because it demands no technique—only the courage to rest in what is already present: the silence before thought, the space between breaths, the openness that holds the world without being touched by it. Here, Śakti as void is not absence, but the radiant freedom that is Bhairava himself.</p>
<p>When you speak with a friend, notice the space before your response. When you pause your music, feel the silence that holds the memory of sound. These are not practices to perfect—they are invitations to recognize what never departed. In that recognition, you do not "enter" stillness—you realize you were never outside it.</p>

<h3>String Instruments Revealing</h3>

<div class="translation">
<p>Listening with undivided mind<br />
to the sustained tones of stringed instruments—<br />
played in sequence yet flowing without break—<br />
one becomes, at their culmination,<br />
the very form of the supreme ether.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Lakshmanjoo's Transmission</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>Musical string instruments are called tantrī. Tantrīdi refers to all string instruments which produce vādya-śabda (musical sounds). In these sounds, for instance in the sitar, you will find separate notes, but if you penetrate to the depth of hearing, you will perceive that collectively one unified resonance emerges from the instrument.</p>
<p>This unified sound can be perceived by anyone, but especially by those maintaining unwavering awareness. Though these sounds are dīrgha (prolonged) and kramasaṃsthita (successively played as the musician places fingers on strings), the practitioner focuses on their unified essence. The one-pointed aspirant (ananyacetāḥ) who concentrates on this collective resonance ultimately becomes absorbed in paravyoma (the supreme ether of consciousness), which is none other than cidākāśa (the space of pure awareness).</p>
<p>This dhāraṇā represents śāktopāya touching śāmbhavopāya. It would be pure śāmbhavopāya, but there is an initial reliance on concentration. One must first focus on differentiated sounds to perceive their unified essence. As long as one seeks the collective sound within differentiated sounds, this is śāktopāya. When the collective sound is fully realized, one enters śāmbhavopāya. This is nimīlanā (inward absorption). Śāmbhavopāya is entirely nimīlanā. After this absorption, krama mudrā naturally arises, leading to unmīlanā samādhi—this is pure śāmbhavopāya.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Extended Commentary</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>This verse reveals music not as entertainment, but as a mirror of consciousness. The musician plays notes in sequence, yet the awakened ear hears only one unbroken song—the same way awareness, though appearing as thoughts, sensations, and perceptions, is always one seamless flow.</p>
<p>The key is <em>ananya-cetāḥ</em>: undivided attention. Not analyzing, not preferring one tone over another, but allowing the entire auditory field to be held in open, non-grasping awareness. In that listening, the “I” that hears fades, and what remains is hearing itself—luminous, empty, and whole.</p>
<p>The “supreme ether” (<em>para-vyoma</em>) is not a metaphysical realm. It is the living space in which all sound arises and subsides—vast, unchanging, and self-aware. To “become its form” is not transformation, but recognition: you are not separate from the openness that holds every note, every breath, every moment.</p>
<p>Thus, the sitar’s melody is not leading you somewhere. It is revealing where you already are—when you listen not with the ear, but with the heart of silence.</p>

<h3>Piṇḍa Mantras</h3>

<div class="translation">
<p>Uttering all the piṇḍa mantras<br />
through the sequence of gross phonemes—<br />
from ardhacandra through bindu to nāda—<br />
one becomes Śiva<br />
through the resonance of the void.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Lakshmanjoo's Transmission</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>This describes a practice that begins as āṇavopāya but matures into śāmbhavopāya. The piṇḍa mantras—such as sauḥ or hrīṃ—are first pronounced externally in their gross form (sthūla-varṇa-krameṇa). Then awareness turns inward, following the subtle dissolution of sound through its inner stages: ardhacandra (the crescent moon phase), bindu (the point), and nāda (the unstruck resonance), culminating in nādānta—the limit of vibration where sound merges into silence.</p>
<p>At this threshold, one doesn't "utter" the void (śūnya) as a syllable; one resonates with it (uccāra here meaning "awakened vibrational presence," not vocalization). In that resonance—śūnyoccārāt—the meditator isn't achieving Śiva; Śiva is recognized as one's essential nature. The process begins with effort but concludes in spontaneity: as awareness touches nāda, the mind naturally subsides into unmanā, the state beyond mental activity.</p>
<p>While rooted in mantra recitation, the culmination is pure śāmbhavopāya—direct, non-conceptual abidance in the silent ground of being.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Extended Commentary</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>Verse 42 maps the journey from sound to silence—not as abandonment, but as deepening. The <em>piṇḍa mantra</em>, compact and potent, acts as a vehicle. Its gross pronunciation anchors attention; its inner dissolution reveals the layers of awareness beneath articulation.</p>
<p>The sequence—<em>ardhacandra → bindu → nāda</em>—is not spatial, but experiential:<br />
- <em>Ardhacandra</em> is the threshold where form begins to blur;<br />
- <em>Bindu</em> is the point of maximum concentration before release;<br />
- <em>Nāda</em> is the humming stillness that underlies all vibration.</p>
<p>When sound reaches its limit (<em>nādānta</em>), what remains is not absence, but the open field in which all sound arises—the <em>śūnya</em> that is not void of reality, but void of separation.</p>
<p>“Uttering the void” (<em>śūnyoccāra</em>) is paradoxical by design. You cannot speak emptiness; you can only <em>be</em> it. The “utterance” is the spontaneous upsurge of awareness when the last trace of objectivity dissolves. In that moment, the reciter, the recitation, and the recited collapse into one taste: Śiva.</p>
<p>This is not a linear path, but a spiral. Each repetition of the mantra is an invitation to listen more deeply—not to the sound, but to the silence that cradles it. And in that listening, the practitioner discovers that the goal was never ahead, but already echoing in the space between breaths.</p>

<p>Meditate simultaneously on the void<br />
surrounding your body in every direction.<br />
When the mind is free of all constructs,<br />
everything arises as void.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Lakshmanjoo's Transmission</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>This practice begins with a simple, embodied instruction: sit quietly, close the eyes, and attend to the space immediately around the body—front, back, left, right, above, below—as pure emptiness (vyat). This isn't abstract philosophy; it's spatial awareness turned inward. Initially, the practitioner holds the sense of having a body, then surrounds it with imagined void. This foundational stage belongs to āṇavopāya, as it relies on mental placement and sensory reference.</p>
<p>But the key is nirvikalpa-manas—mind free from conceptual overlay. As attention stabilizes in this all-encompassing void, the boundary between "body" and "space" softens. The body is no longer a solid object in emptiness; it becomes permeable, then transparent, then indistinguishable from the void itself.</p>
<p>At that point, vyat sarvaṃ pravartate—"everything arises as void." Not as negation, but as the natural condition of reality: ungraspable, unlocatable, self-luminous. This isn't annihilation; it's the dissolution of the illusion of separation. What remains is Śiva, not as an entity, but as the boundless openness in which all appearances float like stars in the night sky.</p>
<p>This is nimīlana samādhi—inward-absorbed stillness—where the world vanishes into awareness. Only after this stabilization can unmīlana samādhi—open-eyed, world-embracing realization—arise.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Extended Commentary</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>Verse 43 uses the body not as an obstacle, but as an anchor for boundlessness. The instruction to feel void “on all sides simultaneously” (<em>yugapad</em>) prevents the mind from localizing emptiness in one direction. It forces a panoramic awareness—spherical, not linear.</p>
<p>At first, this void is “around” the body. But as <em>nirvikalpa</em> deepens—no thought, no image, no memory—the container dissolves. There is no “me” inside space; there is only space, awake to itself. The phrase “everything arises as void” does not mean the world disappears. It means the world is seen <em>as</em> void—empty of inherent existence, yet vividly present, like a dream known to be a dream.</p>
<p>This void is not inert. It is <em>cit-ākāśa</em>, the ether of consciousness—responsive, luminous, and free. To “experience everything as void” is to live without fixation: emotions, thoughts, sensations arise and vanish, unclaimed, unresisted, unowned.</p>
<p>The practice ends not with a state to maintain, but with a seeing-through. The body remains, the world remains—but the sense of being a separate self inside it has collapsed into the one taste of reality: empty, full, and utterly free.</p>

</div>

<p class="center">Lakshmanjoo's Transmission</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>This method deepens the previous practice by adding a third axis: the heart (<em>hṛc-śūnyaṃ</em>). The void above (<em>pṛṣṭha-śūnyaṃ</em>) is the space of pure subjectivity, beyond the crown; the void below (<em>mūla-śūnyaṃ</em>) is the root of manifestation, beneath the perineum; and the void in the heart is the center where knowing and being meet.</p>
<p>To hold all three simultaneously (<em>yugapan</em>) with steadiness (<em>sthiram</em>) is not a mental exercise, but an act of total spatial surrender. The mind, having no fixed point to cling to—no “up,” “down,” or “center”—ceases its habitual grasping. In that suspension, <em>nirvikalpatvāt</em>—by virtue of being free from constructs—the <em>nirvikalpodayaḥ</em>, the arising of the thought-free state, dawns not as an achievement, but as the natural condition of awareness when unobscured.</p>
<p>Though it involves intentional focus, the moment the triad of voids is held without fragmentation, the practice belongs to śāktopāya: awareness itself becomes the medium of revelation, not breath, form, or mantra.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Extended Commentary</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>Verse 45 creates a three-dimensional field of emptiness—not as absence, but as the unconditioned space in which all experience arises. The “heart” here is not the physical organ, but the non-local core of awareness, where the knower and known meet in silence.</p>
<p>When void is held above, below, and within at once, the body is no longer a container, but a transparent vessel within boundlessness. The mind, deprived of its usual anchors—identity (above), sensation (below), and emotion (heart)—relaxes into its source.</p>
<p>“Thought-free” (<em>nirvikalpa</em>) does not mean blankness. It is the luminous clarity that remains when the noise of self-reference stops. In that clarity, perception continues—sound, touch, breath—but without the overlay of “me” and “mine.” The world is not denied; it is seen as it is: empty, vivid, and free.</p>
<p>This is not a state to be maintained. It is what is revealed when effort ceases. The “simultaneous arising” (<em>yugapan... tataḥ</em>) is key: the moment attention is fully distributed in emptiness, the illusion of separation collapses—and what was always present shines forth, unobscured.</p>

<p class="center">Lakshmanjoo's Transmission</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>Verse 46 reveals the immediacy of realization: no prolonged practice is required. Even a fleeting, thought-free glimpse (<em>kṣaṇa-mātraṃ</em>) of any bodily locus as pure emptiness (<em>śūnyataiva</em>) is enough to ignite recognition. When this seeing is <em>nirvikalpam</em>—free from conceptual overlay—the seer does not “attain” Śiva; he <em>is</em> Śiva (<em>nirvikalpa-svarūpa-bhāk</em>), for the nature of the perceiver and the perceived emptiness are one.</p>
<p>Verse 47 deepens this insight by expanding it to the entire body. The elements that constitute form—<em>dravya</em> (substance)—are not denied; they are seen as saturated with <em>vyāt</em> (space). This is not imagination, but direct perception: bone is not solid, but porous; blood is not dense, but fluid; even atoms are mostly void. When the body is beheld thus, not as an object, but as openness in motion, the contemplation (<em>bhāvanā</em>) becomes <em>sthirā</em>—naturally stable, no longer dependent on effort.</p>
<p>Both verses belong to śāktopāya: awareness alone, free from ritual or breath, reveals the truth. The moment emptiness is seen—not absence, but the essence of form—the mind settles not by suppression, but by recognition.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Extended Commentary</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>These verses dismantle the final stronghold of identification: the belief in the body as solid and separate. Verse 46 offers liberation in an instant—not as drama, but as quiet seeing. The "point" (tan-mātre) can be anywhere: the tip of a finger, the hollow behind the eyes, the space between ribs. In that single flash of non-conceptual awareness, the illusion of density collapses.</p>
<p>The address "O gazelle-eyed one" (mṛgekṣaṇe) is no mere poetic convention. The gazelle possesses eyes that see in nearly all directions simultaneously—alert, unblinking, sensitive to the subtlest movement. This is the quality of perception the text cultivates: not fragmented attention that grasps at objects one by one, but panoramic awareness that perceives the totality of experience without fixation.</p>
<p>In tantric symbolism, the gazelle's eyes represent more than physical sight—they are windows to awakened consciousness itself. Just as a gazelle senses danger before it materializes, the practitioner learns to perceive reality before the mind fractures it into separate things. The goddess is addressed this way not merely as endearment, but as acknowledgment of her all-seeing wisdom—the ability to discern emptiness within apparent solidity, space within seeming density.</p>
<p>Verse 47 extends this insight without strain. You do not need to dissolve the body; you only need to see that it was never truly solid. Modern physics echoes this: matter is 99.999% empty space. The Tantric seer goes further: even the remaining "particle" is a ripple in awareness. When this is seen, the body is no longer a prison, but a dance of light in space.</p>
<p>"Steady contemplation" (bhāvanā sā sthirā bhavet) does not mean constant focus. It means the mind no longer recoils from emptiness. Once the body is known as space, every sensation—pain, pleasure, warmth, pressure—is experienced within openness, not as a threat to identity.</p>
<p>This is not negation of life, but its fullest embrace. To live as nirvikalpa-svarūpa is to walk, speak, and breathe as void—responsive, luminous, and free. The world remains, but the one who suffered in it has vanished—and what remains is Bhairava, shining as the emptiness that holds all form.</p>

<h3>A Hollow Shell</h3>

<p class="sanskrit-block">
देहान्तरे त्वग्विभागं भित्तिभूतं विचिन्तयेत्।<br>

</p>

<div class="translation">
<p>Contemplate the body as a hollow shell—<br />
skin as walls, nothing within.<br />
Meditating thus,<br />
one becomes the One<br />
who is never an object of meditation.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Lakshmanjoo's Transmission</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>This practice continues the inquiry into the body’s true nature. One visualizes the skin (<em>tvak</em>) as a mere boundary (<em>bhitti-bhūtam</em>), like the walls of an empty house, with absolutely nothing inside (<em>na kiñcid antare</em>). This is not denial of physiological reality, but a direct deconstruction of the assumption that the body is a solid, substantial “self.”</p>
<p>When this contemplation is sustained without conceptual interference, the meditator (<em>dhyāyan</em>) does not attain an object called “Śiva.” Rather, he becomes <em>nadhyeya-bhāk</em>—“the one who is never meditated upon,” because he is the subject itself, the unobjectifiable ground of all experience.</p>
<p>Though it begins with mental placement (classifying it under śāktopāya), the moment the sense of inner density dissolves and only luminous emptiness remains, the method reveals its true nature: śāmbhavopāya, where even the trace of “meditation” vanishes.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Extended Commentary</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>Verse 48 offers a visceral, almost architectural metaphor: the body as an empty room. Skin is not a container of “me,” but a porous membrane through which life flows. Inside? Not organs, not emotions, not even awareness as a thing—but openness.</p>
<p>This is not nihilism. It is liberation from the claustrophobia of self-identification. When you no longer believe the body is “yours” or “you,” it becomes light, transparent—a field of sensation without ownership. Pain may arise, but it is no longer “my pain.” Breath moves, but not “my breath.”</p>
<p>“To become the One who is never an object of meditation” is the crux. Śiva cannot be seen, known, or experienced—because he is the seeing itself. The moment you stop trying to grasp him as a goal, you realize you’ve never been apart from him.</p>
<p>This practice culminates not in a vision, but in unburdening. The body remains, but the weight of “I am this” falls away—and what stands revealed is not emptiness as lack, but as the boundless space in which all life dances.</p>

<h3>Drawn Into The Heart's Sky</h3>

<div class="translation">
<p>With senses drawn into the heart’s sky—<br />
resting between the twin lotuses—<br />
and mind undivided,<br />
O Blessed One,<br />
one attains supreme blessedness.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Lakshmanjoo's Transmission</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>The “heart’s sky” (<em>hṛdy-ākāśa</em>) is not the physical organ, but the inner void at the core of awareness—described as the space between two lotuses: one facing upward (representing ascent into pure subjectivity), the other downward (representing descent into manifestation). The practitioner (<em>nilīnākṣaḥ</em>) withdraws the senses inward—not by force, but by natural absorption—and fixes attention in this luminous center (<em>padma-saṃpuṭa-madhyagaḥ</em>).</p>
<p>With <em>ananya-cetāḥ</em>—undivided, unwavering focus—the usual fragmentation of perception ceases. In that stillness, the boundary between inner and outer, self and world, dissolves. What arises is not an emotion, but <em>paraṃ saubhāgyam</em>: the highest fortune, which is none other than abidance in Śiva-consciousness itself.</p>
<p>This is śāktopāya: awareness, unsupported by breath or mantra, becomes the sole medium of realization. The “blessedness” is not granted; it is recognized as one’s ever-present nature.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Extended Commentary</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>Verse 49 returns to the heart—not as sentiment, but as the non-local axis of being. The “twin lotuses” symbolize the union of transcendence and immanence: the upward-facing blossom opens into the formless, the downward into the world of form. Between them is not a point in space, but the timeless now where all duality collapses.</p>
<p>To “merge the senses” (<em>nilīnākṣaḥ</em>) is not to shut them down, but to let them dissolve into the awareness that animates them. Sound, touch, sight—no longer pulling outward—return to their source like rivers emptying into the ocean.</p>
<p>“Undivided mind” (<em>ananya-cetāḥ</em>) is key. Not concentration as tension, but as total availability. When attention is fully present, the heart is no longer a metaphor—it becomes the living reality: vast, open, and self-luminous.</p>
<p>“Supreme blessedness” (<em>paraṃ saubhāgyam</em>) is not joy as a reaction, but the quiet fullness of being what one is. It is the natural state when the illusion of separation ends—not in annihilation, but in homecoming.</p>
<p>Thus, this practice is not about reaching the heart, but recognizing that you have never left it. Every breath, every thought, every sensation arises within this boundless center—and to rest there, even for a moment, is to touch the eternal.</p>

<h3>Dissolving Into The Dvādaśānta</h3>

<p>When the mind dissolves into the dvādaśānta—<br />
and the entire body is known as void in every part—<br />
then, with unwavering resolve,<br />
the steadfast Reality reveals itself.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Lakshmanjoo's Transmission</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>This practice unifies two dimensions: the singular focus at <em>dvādaśānta</em>—the point twelve finger-widths above the crown, the threshold of pure subjectivity—and the simultaneous perception of the whole body as permeated by that same void. The practitioner does not merely concentrate <em>at</em> the dvādaśānta; he sees that the emptiness experienced there is not confined to one location, but saturates every pore, every cell, every breath of the body.</p>
<p>This is done with <em>dṛḍha-buddhi</em>—a firm, unwavering intellect—not rigid, but resolute in its non-grasping. When the mind fully merges (<em>manolayāt</em>) into this unified field of emptiness, the <em>tattva-lakṣyaṃ</em>, the true target of all seeking (which is Śiva himself), manifests not as an object, but as the self-evident ground of being.</p>
<p>Though it involves initial placement of attention, the moment the inner and outer voids are recognized as one, the method belongs to pure śāktopāya: awareness alone reveals what has always been present.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Extended Commentary</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>Verse 50 bridges concentration and expansion. The <em>dvādaśānta</em> is often mistaken for a distant point “above” the head. But here, it is not a spatial goal—it is the quality of openness that, once recognized, is seen to pervade the entire body.</p>
<p>The instruction is radical: the void between the brows—the space of pure seeing—is the same void in your fingertips, your breath, your bones. There is no “inside” or “outside” to emptiness. When this is truly seen, the body is no longer a separate entity, but a transparent vibration within boundless awareness.</p>
<p>“Firm intellect” (<em>dṛḍha-buddhi</em>) does not mean intellectual certainty, but the steadiness of non-conceptual knowing. It is the mind that no longer wavers between “real” and “unreal,” “self” and “other.” In that stability, the “Reality” (<em>tattva-lakṣyaṃ</em>) does not “appear”—it is recognized as the silent, luminous ground that was never absent.</p>
<p>This is not a practice to be perfected over time. It is an immediate invitation: wherever you are, feel the space in which your body appears. Let that space breathe you. And in that letting go, what remains is not emptiness as lack—but fullness without center, boundary, or name.</p>

<p>However one may be, wherever one may be—<br />
cast the mind into the dvādaśānta.<br />
Moment after moment,<br />
as mental fluctuations subside,<br />
within days, one becomes wholly new.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Lakshmanjoo's Transmission</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>This verse prescribes a practice of continuous remembrance, not confined to meditation posture but woven into the fabric of daily life. <em>Yathā tathā yatra tatra</em>—“as you are, as it is, wherever you are”—emphasizes that no special condition is required. While walking, speaking, working, or resting, one lightly turns attention to the <em>dvādaśānta</em>, the point twelve finger-widths above the crown, which symbolizes the limitless space of pure awareness.</p>
<p>The key is <em>pratikṣaṇam</em>—unbroken continuity. Not forceful fixation, but a gentle, repeated return to that open center. With this sustained orientation, the <em>vṛttis</em>—mental fluctuations, identifications, and distractions—naturally fade (<em>kṣīṇa-vṛtteḥ</em>). As they dissolve, the ordinary sense of self gives way to <em>vailakṣaṇyam</em>—a state of extraordinary freshness, clarity, and freedom.</p>
<p>Though it begins with intentional focus (placing it in āṇavopāya), the moment this awareness becomes spontaneous, it ripens into śāmbhavopāya. Some readings even suggest <em>kṣaṇāt</em>—“in moments”—indicating that awakening is not bound by time.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Extended Commentary</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>Verse 51 is a masterstroke of practical nonduality. It does not ask you to abandon the world, but to inhabit it with a different axis of attention. The <em>dvādaśānta</em> is not a physical point to locate, but the felt sense of boundlessness that appears when the mind stops contracting around objects.</p>
<p>To “cast the mind” there is not an act of projection, but a release—an unclenching of attention from the immediate foreground of thought and sensation into the background of silent awareness. This can be done while washing dishes, speaking to a friend, or waiting in line. The outer activity continues; the inner orientation shifts.</p>
<p>“Within days” (<em>dinair bhavet</em>) is not a promise of linear progress, but an acknowledgment that when awareness is consistently returned to its source, transformation accelerates. The “newness” (<em>vailakṣaṇyam</em>) is not a new identity, but the freshness of seeing without the dust of memory—each moment arising as if for the first time.</p>
<p>The yogi finds freedom not apart from life, but in the midst of it. The world remains, but the one who was burdened by it has vanished—and what walks, speaks, and acts is only the luminous void, awake to itself.</p>

the entire world is already ash—<br />

</div>

<p class="center">Lakshmanjoo's Transmission</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>These meditation practices expose the fundamental nature of all phenomena, not through visualization, but through direct recognition. The "Fire of Time" (kālāgni) is not conjured; it is the ever-present truth of transience itself. The body described as "one's own fortress" (svakaṃ puram) is not burned by effort, but seen as already ephemeral, a temporary citadel in the unchanging ground of awareness.</p>
<p>Bhairava does not instruct us to imagine burning; He reveals what is already true: all form is already returning to its source. In that recognition (vicintayed), not projection, the last vestige of solidity dissolves, and what remains (ante) is not absence, but śānta-bhāsaḥ—the radiant stillness that was never disturbed by form or formlessness.</p>
<p>When this recognition extends beyond the body to all worlds (jagat sarvaṃ), and the mind remains undivided (ananya-cetasaḥ), there is no "attainment" of the supreme state (parama puṃ-bhāvaḥ). There is only the collapse of the illusion that awareness was ever bound by form. This is not śāktopāya becoming śāmbhavopāya; it is the immediate recognition that both were always one.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Extended Commentary</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>These verses are among the most misunderstood in the Vijñāna Bhairava. They are not prescriptions for visualizing destruction, but revelations of what is already so. The "Fire of Time" is not a technique to practice—it is the natural law of impermanence, always at work, whether seen or not.</p>
<p>Your body is not <em>to be</em> burned; it is <em>being</em> burned. Not by literal flames, but by the silent, constant dissolution of every moment into the next. The cells you inhabited this morning are not the cells you inhabit now. The breath you just exhaled will never return. This is not morbidity—it is the living truth. Most turn away from this recognition, clinging to the illusion of permanence. But the sage sees through, and in that seeing, the body becomes transparent, not as corpse, but as light.</p>
<p>"Your own city reduced to ash" is not an image to hold—it is the collapse of identification. That "you" who worries about preservation, aging, and death is itself a flickering appearance in awareness. When this is recognized—not as philosophy, but as lived reality—the fortress gates swing open, and what remains is not devastation, but <em>śānta-bhāsaḥ</em>: luminous, undisturbed peace. This is not found <em>after</em> the burning; it is recognized <em>as</em> the burning itself. Like a flame that appears to consume yet is itself composed of constant transformation, peace is not beyond impermanence—it is its very nature.</p>
<p>This extends to the world. "The entire world as already ash" is not nihilism. It is the seeing-through of the dream of solidity. Your most cherished relationships, ambitions, even this spiritual path—all are already dissolving. Not to be mourned, but seen clearly. When you truly recognize this—not as thought, but as the ground of your being—the mind no longer clings (<em>ananya-cetasaḥ</em>). There is no "attainment" of the supreme state because the one who would attain has dissolved in the recognition.</p>
<p>Right now, as you read these words, feel the space in which they appear. That space is already free from burning and not-burning. The letters arise and vanish within it, yet it remains untouched. Your body, too, is this space—appearing as form, yet empty of separate existence. The world, too, is this space—dancing in time, yet never bound by it.</p>
<p>This is not an invitation to practice burning. It is an invitation to stop reinforcing the illusion that anything was ever solid. The fire of time needs no tending—it is already consuming the illusion of permanence. Your only task is to recognize what remains when that illusion burns away: not a state to achieve, but the ever-present awareness in which all states arise and vanish. That is Bhairava: not beyond the fire, but as the untouched space within which both fire and ash appear.</p>
<p>In that recognition, there is no separate self to be destroyed and no external world to burn. There is only one reality, already whole, already free—recognizing itself in the midst of all appearing and seeing through the appearance of motion towards recognition itself.</p>

At the end of this dissolution,<br />
the Supreme reveals herself.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Lakshmanjoo's Transmission</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>This practice unfolds through progressive refinement. One begins with the gross elements of the body or universe and successively dissolves them into ever more subtle layers of reality: earth into water, water into fire, fire into air, air into space, space into mind, mind into ego, ego into pure “I”-consciousness (<em>aham</em>), and that into universal “I” (<em>mahāprakāśa</em>), until even that merges into <em>turīyātīta</em>—the state beyond the fourth, where all distinctions vanish.</p>
<p>This sequential absorption (<em>nilayam</em>) is not intellectual, but experiential. It mirrors the natural involution of consciousness during deep sleep, but here it is done with full awareness. The practitioner does not “go” anywhere; rather, layers of identification are seen through and released.</p>
<p>Since it involves intentional movement through levels of reality, it belongs to śāktopāya. Yet as the final veil thins, the method dissolves into śāmbhavopāya—the spontaneous recognition of the Supreme (<em>parā</em>) as one’s own nature.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Extended Commentary</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>Verse 54 offers a map of interiority—not as cosmology, but as liberation through refinement. The "elements" (tattvāni) are not just physical substances, but modes of self-identification: the body, emotions, thoughts, the sense of "I am," even the luminous witness. Each is subtler than the last, yet each is still a veil over pure awareness.</p>
<p>To "merge one after another" is to inquire: Is this me?<br />
—The body? No.<br />
—The feelings? No.<br />
—The thoughts? No.<br />
—The witness of thoughts? Still not final.</p>
<p>This is not rejection, but recognition. Each layer is honored, then released—not as false, but as incomplete. The dream state is more subtle than waking, deep sleep subtler than dream, and the silent witness subtler still. But even this witness is transcended where subject and object collapse.</p>
<p>"Revealed" does not mean the Supreme appears as a new experience. She is what remains when all that is not-Self has been seen through. The world and body are not denied; they are recognized as expressions of her play—temporary, luminous, and empty of separate existence.</p>
<p>Thus, this practice is not a journey upward, but a deepening inward—until the last ripple of self-reference stills, and what was always whole stands revealed.</p>

<h3>Freedom Within Dreams</h3>

<p class="sanskrit-block">

<div class="translation">
<p>Meditating on the breath-energy<br />
as resonant and slow,<br />
held within the dvādaśānta—<br />
and, entering the heart while falling asleep,<br />
one who continues this awareness<br />
gains freedom within the dream.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Lakshmanjoo's Transmission</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>This method works with the subtle rhythm of breath at the threshold of sleep. The practitioner sustains awareness of <em>śakti</em>—the energy of breath—as <em>piṇḍaṃ ca durbalaṃ</em>: “resonant” (producing a soft inner sound, as in ujjāyī) and “slow” or “prolonged” (<em>durbalam</em>, here meaning extended, relaxed). This breath is anchored in <em>dvādaśa-gocara</em>, the field of the dvādaśānta, which manifests in three experiential centers: the heart, the throat, or the space between the brows—all regarded as expressions of the true <em>hṛdaya</em>, the non-local heart of awareness.</p>
<p>Maintaining this focus while transitioning into sleep, the practitioner carries conscious presence into the dream state. As a result, <em>svapna-svātantryam</em>—mastery or freedom in dreaming—arises: the dreamer recognizes the dream as dream and moves within it with full creative autonomy. This is not mere lucidity, but the expression of <em>svātantrya</em>, the divine freedom of consciousness, now active even in the subtle realm of sleep.</p>
<p>Though it uses breath and posture (placing it initially in āṇavopāya), the moment awareness permeates the dream, it becomes śāktopāya—awareness itself guiding the subtle body.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Extended Commentary</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>Verse 55 bridges waking discipline and nocturnal liberation. The “resonant, slow breath” is not forced; it is the natural breath of deep relaxation, accompanied by a faint inner hum—a thread of awareness woven into the fabric of sleep.</p>
<p>The <em>dvādaśa-gocara</em>—the “reach of the twelve”—is not a fixed point, but the expanse of inner space where attention stabilizes. Whether felt at the heart (emotional center), throat (expression), or brow (insight), it is the same openness: the doorway between waking and dreaming.</p>
<p>To “enter the heart while falling asleep” is to fall <em>into</em> awareness, not out of it. Most lose consciousness at sleep’s edge; here, one surrenders the body but retains the thread of presence. As dream images arise, they are no longer mistaken for reality. The dream becomes a field of spontaneous awareness—where consciousness freely manifests whatever it wills: visions of deities, landscapes of insight, or symbolic resolutions of waking knots.</p>
<p>This “freedom in dreaming” (<em>svapna-svātantryam</em>) is more than control—it is recognition. The dreamer knows: <em>This is me. This is my awareness dreaming itself.</em> And in that knowing, the boundary between waking, dreaming, and deep sleep begins to dissolve.</p>
<p>Thus, this practice is not about manipulating dreams, but about waking up within them—and in doing so, revealing that all states, all worlds, are nothing but the spontaneous expression of the one, unbound awareness.</p>

<div class="translation">
<p>Meditate successively on the entirety of manifestation—<br />

until the mind dissolves into its source.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Lakshmanjoo's Transmission</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>This practice unfolds through the three adhvans (paths of manifestation). The bhuvanādhva, or path of worlds, includes the gross experiential universe from Pātāla to Satyaloka, perceived as tangible form. The tattvādhva, or path of principles, reveals the 36 tattvas that structure experience—from earth to Śiva—subtle frameworks normally invisible to ordinary perception. The kalādhva, or path of powers, discloses the five kalās (nivr̥tti, pratiṣṭhā, vidyā, śānti, śāntyatīta) that pulse as the supreme flow of consciousness beyond all division.</p>
<p>The practitioner doesn't intellectualize these layers but experiences them as descending refinement. Starting with the gross world (sthūla), attention moves to the subtle architecture of the tattvas (sūkṣma), and finally recognizes that even these arise from the indivisible play of Śakti (parā).</p>
<p>This sequential refinement (kramaśaḥ) isn't mechanical—it unfolds naturally as awareness deepens. When conceptual scaffolding dissolves at the culmination (yāvad ante), the mind has no object to grasp and dissolves into its source (manolayaḥ). While it begins in śāktopāya (using contemplation as support), it culminates in śāmbhavopāya: direct, objectless recognition of one's true nature.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Extended Commentary</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>This verse offers a cosmic homecoming, not an escape. It reverses the usual flow of manifestation—not building reality from One to many, but tracing the many back to the One from which they arise.</p>
<p>The "entirety of manifestation" (akhilam) includes everything we perceive—mountains and thoughts, emotions and galaxies. The "sequential stages" (kramaśaḥ) aren't a ladder to climb, but layers to see through: the gross world of objects; the subtle principles that structure them; and the supreme dimension where all distinction collapses.<br />
What does this mean in immediate experience? When you see a tree, the gross (sthūla) is its physical form. The subtle (sūkṣma) is the network of life-force, consciousness, and elements that sustain it. The supreme (parā) is the luminous awareness in which both tree and perceiver arise. To "meditate successively" is to see all three at once—not as analysis, but as a single flash of recognition that collapses the illusion of separation.</p>
<p>"Mind dissolves" (manolayaḥ) is not unconsciousness. It is the moment when the mind stops dividing reality into "me" and "not-me." When you gaze at a sunset without the subtle commentary of "I am seeing beauty," the sunset doesn't vanish—it intensifies. The mind that named and claimed has dissolved, and only seeing remains.</p>
<p>This is not rejection of the world but its consummation. When the last veil of separation burns away, what remains is not absence but the one taste of reality: Bhairava, not as a distant ideal, but as the space in which all experience arises, dances, and dissolves. In that dissolution, you don't lose the world—you find it as your own heart.</p>

<h3>Contemplating Shiva Throughout</h3>

<p>Contemplating the Śaiva Reality<br />
throughout this entire universe—<br />
at its furthest reaches in every direction—<br />
by the method of the adhvan,<br />
one awakens to the Great Dawn.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Lakshmanjoo's Transmission</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>This dharana invites expansive, non-dual vision. The practitioner stands or sits immersed in the world—garden, sky, earth—and perceives the totality of manifestation (<em>asya sarvasya viśvasya</em>) not as external, but as the very field of Śiva’s being. Using <em>adhva-prakriyā</em>, the Tantric understanding of reality’s layered unfolding (bhuvanādhva, tattvādhva, kalādhva), one sees that every atom, every world, every dimension—from the 118 lokas below to the highest śakti realms above—is nothing but the pulsation of one’s own consciousness.</p>
<p>There is no separation between “me” and “the universe.” The vastness is not outside; it is the natural radiance of <em>aham</em>, the “I” of pure subjectivity. This is <em>prakriyā-jñāna</em>: knowledge not as information, but as direct recognition that all is Self. In that seeing, the <em>mahodayaḥ</em>—the Great Awakening—dawns: not as an event in time, but as the irrevocable clarity of the ever-present state of Bhairava.</p>
<p>This is pure śāktopāya: awareness alone, unmediated by breath or form, reveals the universe as the living body of Śiva.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Extended Commentary</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>Verse 57 turns cosmology into liberation. The “ultimate limit in every direction” (<em>paryanteṣu samantataḥ</em>) is not a boundary to reach, but an invitation to boundlessness. Whether gazing at stars or feeling the earth beneath your feet, you recognize: this is not “my world”—this <em>is</em> me.</p>
<p>The <em>adhva-prakriyā</em> is not a map to study, but a lens to see through. The 118 worlds are symbolic of all possible states of experience—gross, subtle, causal—none of which exist apart from awareness. To “imagine” the universe as your own consciousness is not fantasy, but the undoing of the primal forgetfulness that says “I am small.”</p>
<p>“Great Awakening” (<em>mahodayaḥ</em>) is the collapse of that contraction. It is not enlightenment as a distant peak, but the simple, staggering realization: <em>There is no outside.</em> The garden, the sky, the breath, the thought—all are waves in the ocean of your being.</p>
<p>This is the essence of <em>aham sarvam</em>—“I am all.” Not as egoic inflation, but as humility before the infinite. In that recognition, every step is a dance, every sight a revelation, and the ordinary world—seen without division—becomes the radiant body of Bhairava.</p>

<h3>Universe As Transparent Emptiness</h3>

<p class="sanskrit-block">

<div class="translation">
<p>O Great Goddess,<br />
this entire universe<br />
is already transparent emptiness—<br />
not as concept, but as your immediate experience.<br />
There, the mind dissolves not by effort,<br />
but by recognition—<br />
and in that dissolution,<br />
you are not "fit to merge" into the supreme Void—<br />
you are the Void itself,<br />
awake to itself.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Lakshmanjoo's Transmission</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>The instruction to "imagine the universe as void" is not to fabricate a new reality, but to recognize what is already the case. The cosmos is śūnya-bhūtam—"empty in essence"—not because it lacks appearance, but because all forms are transparent to the awareness in which they arise. This is not nihilism, but the direct apprehension that phenomena have no independent substance apart from consciousness itself.</p>
<p>The dissolution of mind (mano līnam) in this emptiness is not a process to achieve, but the natural collapse of the subject-object structure when seen through. There is no "becoming fit" to merge with the supreme Void (para-śūnya)—as if one must qualify through practice. Rather, the moment the illusion of separation ends, what remains is recognized as one's true nature: the unbounded awareness in which both universe and void appear as passing expressions.</p>
<p>Though it begins with contemplation (vicintayet), this is not a technique of the individual mind. It is the mind's own intelligence turning back upon itself and recognizing its source. What appears as śāktopāya—the power of discriminative awareness—reveals itself as the spontaneous recognition of non-dual reality.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Extended Commentary</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>This verse does not ask you to make the world disappear—it asks you to see through what was never solid. The universe is not being denied; its true nature is being revealed. When you look at your hand right now, is it truly a solid thing? Or is it a shimmering constellation of sensation, light, and space appearing within awareness? This is not philosophy—it is direct perception.</p>
<p>The "void" is not absence. It is the unconditioned space in which all experience arises—luminous, responsive, and free. Every atom of your body, every star in the sky, every thought in your mind—all are already transparent to this living emptiness. There is no need to "dissolve" the mind into this void, for the mind is itself a ripple in this same emptiness. The apparent dissolution is simply recognition coming home to itself.</p>
<p>The phrase "fit to merge" (<em>tallaya-bhājanam</em>) is not about qualification or attainment. It points to what happens when the illusion of being separate evaporates: you don't "enter" the supreme Void—you recognize you were never outside it. The wave need not become ocean; it need only recognize it was ocean all along. Even the sense of "I am recognizing" dissolves in this seeing, leaving only pure awareness—self-luminous, self-knowing, and free.</p>
<p>Try this now: look at the room around you. See the forms, the colors, the objects—but don't stop there. Look deeper. Feel the space in which they appear. That space is not empty of awareness; it is awareness itself, already whole, already free. There is no distance between you and this recognition. It is not a future attainment but the ever-present ground beneath all appearance.</p>
<p>This is not about creating emptiness through imagination. It is about removing the filters of solidity we impose on experience. When you see a mountain, you are not seeing solid matter—you are witnessing awareness appearing as mountain. When you hear a bird, you are not hearing sound as separate entity—you are witnessing awareness appearing as sound. In this seeing, there is no "you" separate from what is seen. There is only seeing—luminous, boundless, and awake.</p>
<p>Thus, this practice is not a method to follow but a recognition to allow. You do not become the Void by effort—you are already the Void, recognizing itself through every sensation, every breath, every moment of being. This is not philosophy to understand but reality to inhabit. And in that inhabiting, the universe does not vanish—it shines with the radiance of your true nature.</p>

<h3>Space Within A Vessel</h3>

<div class="translation">
<p>Fix your gaze upon the space within a jar<br />
or any vessel,<br />
discarding its walls as mere illusion.<br />
Instantly merging into that emptiness,<br />
you become one with it.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Lakshmanjoo's Transmission</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>This is a direct, immediate gateway of śāmbhavopāya. Place before you a simple vessel—a pot, a cup, a bowl—and look not at its material form, but at the space it contains. Then, let go of the perception of the container itself (<em>bhittis tyaktvā</em>—“abandoning the walls”). See only the openness, the void, unbounded by shape or substance.</p>
<p>In that unmediated seeing—eyes open, mind ungrasping—the boundary between inner and outer dissolves. There is no “you” looking at “space.” Awareness simply rests as space. And in that instant (<em>tat-kṣaṇāt</em>), one merges (<em>tal-layam</em>) and becomes fully identified with that void (<em>tanmayo bhavet</em>).</p>
<p>This void is not inert. It is the living emptiness of Śiva—pure, self-aware, and all-pervading. The vessel is merely a pointer; the true space is the boundless <em>cid-ākāśa</em>, the ether of consciousness in which the entire universe appears and vanishes.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Extended Commentary</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>Verse 59 strips meditation to its essence: seeing without naming. The jar is arbitrary—a stand-in for any form. The instruction is to see <em>through</em> it, not <em>at</em> it. The “walls” (<em>bhitti</em>) symbolize all conceptual boundaries—identity, time, separation. To discard them is not to deny their appearance, but to refuse their authority.</p>
<p>This is not visualization. It is de-visualization. You do not imagine emptiness; you stop overlaying solidity. The moment you cease reinforcing the “clay” of perception, only space remains—and you are that space.</p>
<p>“Instantly merging” (<em>tat-kṣaṇād gatvā</em>) reveals the immediacy of recognition. No preparation, no stages—only the willingness to see what is already true. The void in the pot is the same void in your chest, in the sky, in the silence between thoughts.</p>
<p>To “become one with it” (<em>tanmayo bhavet</em>) is not union of two things, but the end of the illusion that there were two. There is no “I” merging with emptiness. There is only emptiness, awake to itself.</p>
<p>Thus, the humble pot becomes a mirror of the absolute. In its hollow core, the universe is revealed—not as object, but as the open, luminous ground of all that is, was, and will be.</p>

<h3>Bare, Featureless Expanse</h3>

When the mind settles there,<br />
all mental fluctuations cease.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Lakshmanjoo's Transmission</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>This practice uses the outer landscape as a mirror for inner stillness. One goes to a vast, featureless expanse—desert, plain, open sky—where the eye finds no object to cling to. In that visual emptiness, the habitual scattering of the mind loses its anchors. There is nothing to name, nothing to desire or reject.</p>
<p>By simply gazing without fixation (<em>dṛṣṭiṃ vinikṣipet</em>), awareness naturally relaxes. The mind, deprived of its usual food—form, boundary, story—turns inward not by effort, but by exhaustion of outward impulse. In that settling (<em>vilīne manase bhāve</em>), the <em>vṛttis</em>—thought-waves, emotional currents, mental noise—subside of their own accord (<em>vṛtti-kṣayaḥ prajāyate</em>).</p>
<p>This is śāmbhavopāya in its purest form: no mantra, no breath, no visualization—only open-eyed abidance in boundless space. The outer void reflects the inner; and in that reflection, the seer vanishes.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Extended Commentary</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>Verse 60 reveals that stillness is not cultivated—it is uncovered. The “bare place” (<em>nir-urkṣa-giri-bhitti-ādi-deśa</em>) is not merely physical; it is any moment in which perception is not hijacked by form. Even in a city, one can find such space—in the gap between buildings, in the sky above rooftops, in the pause between thoughts.</p>
<p>The instruction is not to <em>do</em> anything, but to <em>stop doing</em>. The gaze is soft, not focused on any point. The mind, accustomed to chasing objects, begins to unravel when there is nothing to chase. Like a river entering the ocean, it loses its name and form.</p>
<p>“Thoughts dissolve by themselves” (<em>vṛtti-kṣayaḥ prajāyate</em>) is key. This is not suppression. It is the natural quieting that occurs when attention is no longer fragmented. The desert does not silence the mind—the mind silences itself in the presence of unbounded openness.</p>
<p>This practice is especially potent because it requires no special condition beyond what is already available. In any open space—literal or metaphorical—freedom is revealed not as something to attain, but as what remains when the noise of separation ends.</p>
<p>Thus, the empty field becomes a throne of awareness. And the one who gazes? He is not separate from the space he sees—for in that seeing, subject and object melt into the one, luminous void.</p>

<h3>The Space Between Dualities</h3>

<div class="translation">
<p>In the awareness of any two states or objects,<br />
rest in the space between them.<br />
Then, letting go of both at once,<br />
the Truth reveals itself in the center.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Lakshmanjoo's Transmission</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>This practice works with duality as a threshold to unity. One selects any pair—two objects, inhalation and exhalation, sound and silence, thought and gap—and holds awareness at the point <em>between</em> them (<em>madhyaṃ samāśrayet</em>). This “middle” is not spatial, but the instantaneous gap where one perception ends and the next has not yet begun.</p>
<p>Initially, the two poles serve as supports: seeing object A, then object B, and attending to the fleeting neutrality between. With repetition, this midpoint stabilizes. At that moment, one simultaneously releases both (<em>yugapac ca dvayaṃ tyaktvā</em>)—not by force, but by natural disinterest. In that release, the <em>tattva</em>, the essential Reality, shines forth (<em>prakāśate</em>) not as an object, but as the self-luminous ground that was always present beneath the play of pairs.</p>
<p>Though it begins with concentration on perceptual dyads (placing it in śāktopāya), the moment both poles are abandoned and only the center remains, the method opens into śāmbhavopāya—direct, non-dual recognition.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Extended Commentary</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>Verse 61 reveals the secret of all thresholds: the truth is not in the opposites, but in the seam between them. The “two things” can be anything—breath in and out, joy and sorrow, self and world. The practice is not to resolve the tension, but to rest in the pause where tension has not yet arisen.</p>
<p>This “center” (<em>madhya</em>) is not a midpoint in time or space. It is the timeless now—the gap between thoughts, the stillness between heartbeats, the silence between words. In that gap, there is no “this” or “that,” only pure awareness, uncolored by content.</p>
<p>The instruction to “abandon both simultaneously” is pivotal. As long as one pole is subtly held, duality persists. But when both are released—not sequentially, but <em>yugapat</em>, in one motion—awareness snaps back to its source.</p>
<p>This is not intellectual. It is experiential. You do not “find” the center; you stop obscuring it. The moment you cease leaning toward either side, balance reveals itself—not as achievement, but as your natural state.</p>
<p>Thus, every pair in life becomes a doorway. The breath, the glance, the thought—each dyad contains the seed of unity. And in the center, what shines is not new. It is Bhairava, the silent witness behind all coming and going.</p>

and does not move to another,<br />
then, abiding in the gap between,<br />
supreme realization unfolds.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Lakshmanjoo's Transmission</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>This verse presents two valid approaches, both centered on the <em>madhya</em>—the interval between perceptions.</p>
<p><strong>First interpretation</strong>: Fix attention unwaveringly on a single object—a pot, a flame, a syllable—without allowing the mind to drift to any other (<em>naiva bhāvāntaraṃ vrajet</em>). The key is <em>niruddhā cit</em>: awareness held firm, yet alive, not dull or mechanical. When concentration deepens to the point of identity—<em>tanmaya-bhāva</em>—the boundary between subject and object dissolves. The object’s consciousness merges with the perceiver’s, and both open into universal awareness.</p>
<p><strong>Second (preferred) interpretation</strong>: After fully perceiving an object, release it (<em>bhāve tyakte</em>)—but do not grasp another. Rest in the luminous gap where perception has ceased, yet no new object has arisen. This “between” (<em>tan-madhya-bhāvena</em>) is not empty; it is the fertile void from which all manifestation springs. In that stillness, <em>ati-bhāvanā</em>—supreme realization—blossoms spontaneously.</p>
<p>Both paths belong to śāktopāya: awareness, guided by intention, reveals the truth. But the second is more direct, for it bypasses identification with form and rests in pure subjectivity.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Extended Commentary</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>Verse 62 captures the essence of meditative precision. The “gap” is not a void to be filled, but the natural resting place of awareness when freed from compulsive object-seeking.</p>
<p>In the first method, one object becomes a doorway. By attending to it with total presence—without boredom, without anticipation—the object ceases to be “other.” It becomes transparent, revealing the awareness that holds it. This is not absorption <em>into</em> the object, but recognition <em>through</em> it.</p>
<p>The second method is even subtler. It works with the natural rhythm of attention: perceive, release, abide. Most minds leap from one object to the next, never touching the silence between. But here, one pauses—in the moment after a thought ends and before the next begins, after a breath finishes and before the next starts. In that pause, there is no “me,” no “world”—only open, unconditioned presence.</p>
<p>“Supreme realization” (<em>ati-bhāvanā</em>) is not a new state. It is what remains when the habit of grasping ceases. The gap is not empty; it is full of potential—the same potential that births galaxies and thoughts alike.</p>
<p>Thus, this practice is not about concentration as control, but as release. Whether through deep focus on one thing or abiding in the space between things, the goal is the same: to let awareness return to its source. And in that return, what shines is not an experience, but the ever-present ground of all experience.</p>

as nothing but Consciousness itself.<br />
With a simultaneous, thought-free mind,<br />
the supreme awakening dawns.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Lakshmanjoo's Transmission</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>This practice unifies body and cosmos in one recognition: both are <em>cinmaya</em>—made entirely of Consciousness. One does not imagine this as a mental exercise alone, but holds the conviction—<em>paribhāvayet</em>—that every cell, every atom, every star is a pulsation of Śiva’s luminous awareness.</p>
<p>The key is <em>yugapan nirvikalpena manasā</em>: “with a simultaneous, thought-free mind.” This means the contemplation is not discursive; it is immediate and non-conceptual. There is no sequence of reasoning—“this is Consciousness, therefore that is too”—but a single, unified perception in which the distinction between body, world, and awareness collapses.</p>
<p>Though it involves an initial act of recognition (placing it in śāktopāya), the moment the mind abides in this truth without fragmentation, the <em>paramodayaḥ</em>—the supreme dawn of realization—arises not as an event, but as the natural state.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Extended Commentary</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>Verse 63 offers the most direct inversion of ordinary perception. Instead of seeing consciousness as in the body, one sees the body as in consciousness—and not just the body, but the entire cosmos. This is not metaphor. It is ontological truth: matter is condensed awareness; space is its openness; time is its rhythm.</p>
<p>"Simultaneously" is crucial. You do not shift from body to world or world to body. You see them as one seamless field—like waves and ocean. The toe is not separate from the mountain; both are expressions of the same living light.</p>
<p>"Thought-free" does not mean blankness. It means perception without the overlay of naming, judging, or separating. In that clarity, the body is no longer a prison of flesh, but a temple of radiance; the world is no longer a field of threat or desire, but a dance of divine energy.</p>
<p>The "supreme awakening" is not a future achievement. It is what happens when you stop seeing form as solid and recognize it as the play of Consciousness. In that seeing, there is no "you" awakening—there is only awakening, happening as you, as the world, as everything.</p>
<p>Thus, this practice is not about changing reality, but about seeing it as it always was.</p>

for the arising of the knowledge of oneness.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Lakshmanjoo's Transmission</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>This verse points to the pivotal moment in breath-awareness: the <em>saṅghaṭṭa</em>, the “collision” or juncture where exhalation ends and inhalation begins—or vice versa. At that precise threshold, prāṇa and apāna touch, and for a fleeting instant, breath pauses. This suspension may be felt internally—at the heart, between the brows—or externally, in the space twelve finger-widths above the crown (<em>bahirdvādaśānta</em>).</p>
<p>In that natural gap, mental activity subsides, and the dualistic sense of “inner” and “outer” softens. The practitioner, having trained in breath awareness (placing this in āṇavopāya), becomes <em>bhājanam</em>—“fit” or “receptive”—for <em>sāmatva-vijñāna</em>, the direct cognition of equilibrium: the recognition that all apparent opposites arise within one unbroken field of awareness.</p>
<p>Though the method uses breath as support, the insight it yields transcends technique. The “knowledge of harmony” is not intellectual; it is the lived experience of non-duality, where subject and object, self and world, merge in the silent fullness of the present.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Extended Commentary</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>Verse 64 reveals that the breath is not merely a physiological process, but a subtle map of consciousness itself. The “meeting of the two breaths” is not a physical event, but a perceptual threshold—the hinge between giving and receiving, expansion and contraction, manifestation and withdrawal.</p>
<p>At that hinge, time seems to pause. In that pause, the mind—no longer carried outward by exhalation or drawn inward by inhalation—settles of its own accord. This is not forced retention (<em>kumbhaka</em>), but natural suspension arising from refined attention.</p>
<p>“Within or outside” (<em>antar vā bahir</em>) indicates that the locus is not fixed. For some, the gap is felt at the heart—the center of emotional and intuitive awareness. For others, it is at the brow—the seat of insight. For still others, it opens outward into the boundless space above the head, where individuality dissolves.</p>
<p>The “knowledge of oneness” (<em>sāmatva-vijñāna</em>) is not a belief, but a shift in identity. You no longer experience yourself as a separate observer watching breath; you <em>are</em> the space in which breath arises and vanishes. Duality collapses not through effort, but through recognition in the gap.</p>
<p>Thus, this practice is a microcosm of the entire path: in the smallest pause between breaths, the whole of reality is revealed—not as something to attain, but as what has always been present, waiting only for attention to cease its wandering and rest in the centerless center.</p>

<h3>Recognizing Innate Bliss</h3>

<p class="sanskrit-block">
सर्वं जगत् स्वदेहं वा स्वानन्दभरितं स्मरेत्।<br>
युगपत् स्वामृतेनैव परानन्दमयो भवेत्॥६५॥<br>
</p>

<p class="romanized-block">
sarvaṃ jagat sva-dehaṃ vā svānanda-bharitaṃ smaret |<br>
yugapat svāmṛtenaiva parānanda-mayo bhavet ||65||<br>
</p>

<div class="translation">
<p>Contemplate the entire world or your own body<br />
as already overflowing with your innate bliss.<br />
In that very instant,<br />
drenched in your own nectar,<br />
you become one with supreme joy.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Lakshmanjoo's Transmission</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>This practice is a direct invocation of <em>ānanda</em>—the bliss that is not emotional pleasure, but the essential nature of Consciousness itself. One does not generate bliss; one remembers (<em>smaret</em>) that it already fills every atom of the body and every corner of the universe. The word <em>bharitam</em>—“overflowing”—emphasizes that this bliss is not partial or conditional, but complete and uncontainable.</p>
<p>Crucially, this is not a sequential visualization. The instruction <em>yugapat</em>—“simultaneously”—means the recognition must be immediate and all-encompassing: no “first the body, then the world,” but a single, unified perception of totality saturated with joy.</p>
<p>Through this remembrance, one is immersed in <em>svāmṛta</em>—one’s own nectar, the self-secret elixir of awareness. In that immersion, the practitioner does not “attain” <em>parānanda</em>; he <em>becomes</em> it (<em>parānanda-mayo bhavet</em>), for bliss is not an experience added to the self—it is the self, revealed.</p>
<p>This belongs to śāktopāya: the power of recognition (<em>smṛti</em>) alone awakens what has never been absent.</p>
<p>Verse 65 completes the triad begun in verses 63 and 64:<br />
- Verse 63: the world is <em>cinmaya</em>—made of Consciousness (prakāśa, luminosity)<br />
- Verse 64: the world reveals <em>sāmatva</em>—the knowledge of oneness and harmony where all dualities merge<br />
- Verse 65: the world is <em>ānandamaya</em>—made of Bliss (vimarśa, self-aware joy)</p>
<p>Together, they affirm the non-dual nature of reality in its three inseparable dimensions: awareness as luminosity, awareness as unity, and awareness as bliss. These aren't sequential stages but simultaneous aspects of one reality—like light, warmth, and radiance from a single flame.</p>
<p>Verse 64's insight is essential to this triad: consciousness (verse 63) doesn't remain abstract light but naturally reveals itself as unbroken wholeness in the "gap" between all apparent opposites. It's in this unity that bliss (verse 65) isn't emotional reaction but the inherent fullness of being itself.</p>
<p>"Already filled" is the key. You do not pour bliss into the world; you remove the veil that made you think it was empty. Ordinary perception sees lack—"I need this to be happy." The yogi's perception, having recognized both consciousness and unity, sees abundance—"This is already whole."</p>
<p>The "nectar" (<em>amṛta</em>) is not a substance, but the taste of freedom—the sweet certainty that nothing is missing. When you rest in that taste, the boundary between "my bliss" and "supreme bliss" vanishes. There is only one joy, vibrating as galaxies and heartbeats alike.</p>
<p>Thus, this practice is not aspiration, but affirmation. In one flash of simultaneous recognition—holding consciousness, unity and bliss together—the world is transfigured—not because it changed, but because you remembered: you are the bliss that fills it. And in that remembering, Bhairava shines—not as other, but as your own unbroken heart.</p>

<h3>Bliss Arising Through Playful Ruse</h3>

</p>

<div class="translation">
<p>O gazelle-eyed one,<br />
by a playful ruse—<br />
sudden, boundless bliss arises,<br />
and through that, Reality reveals itself.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Lakshmanjoo's Transmission</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>This verse introduces an unconventional, spontaneous method: <em>kuhana</em>—a “trick” or playfully startling touch, such as tickling under the armpits, which triggers uncontrolled laughter. In that moment of spontaneous outburst, the usual mental constructs collapse. The laughter is not mere reflex; it is an eruption of unconditioned joy, free from personal narrative or emotional residue.</p>
<p>The key is not the act itself, but the immediate inquiry: <em>Where does this laughter arise from?</em> In the split second before the mind labels it “mine” or “funny,” there is pure, unmediated delight—a flash of <em>mahānanda</em>, the great bliss that is the very texture of Śiva’s being.</p>
<p>Because this bliss arises without effort, mantra, or breath control—and because it is accessed through direct observation of a natural, bodily-emotive event—it belongs to śāktopāya. The practitioner does not create the experience; they recognize it as the spontaneous expression of their true nature.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Extended Commentary</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>Verse 66 is a masterstroke of wisdom: liberation is not confined to silence, stillness, or solemnity. It can erupt in laughter—in the unguarded, involuntary burst that shatters the armor of self-seriousness.</p>
<p>The “trick” (<em>kuhana</em>) is not manipulation; it is a skillful disruption of habitual identity. Tickling bypasses the thinking mind and triggers a raw, pre-conceptual response. In that gap—between sensation and interpretation—the sense of “I” vanishes, and what remains is pure, bubbling joy.</p>
<p>Most dismiss such laughter as trivial. But the text asks: <em>Why do you laugh uncontrollably, even when you’re suffering?</em> Because beneath sorrow, beneath control, there is a wellspring of joy that cannot be extinguished. That joy is not psychological—it is ontological. It is the vibration of consciousness delighting in itself.</p>
<p>“Reality reveals itself” (<em>tattvaṃ prakāśate</em>) not as a vision, but as the ground of that laughter. When you trace it to its source—not the nerves under the arm, but the space from which the impulse to laugh springs—you touch the heart of Bhairava: playful, fearless, and utterly free.</p>
<p>Thus, this practice is not about tickling—it is about readiness. In any moment of spontaneous release—laughter, awe, tears—the door opens. The only task is to not close it with thought. To rest, just for an instant, in the naked delight before the mind says “me.” And in that instant, all is revealed.</p>

<h3>Withdrawing Through Upward Breath</h3>

<p class="sanskrit-block">

<div class="translation">
<p>When all senses naturally withdraw<br />
through the gentle current of breath<br />
flowing upward,<br />
in the moment the subtle sensation<br />
of ants crawling arises—<br />
there, supreme bliss reveals itself.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Lakshmanjoo's Transmission</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>This meditation is not about forcing the senses to close, but allowing attention to gather in the central axis of awareness. The "upward-flowing prāṇa-śakti" is not a physical energy moving in the spine, but the natural orientation of awareness turning toward its source.</p>
<p>As this inner gathering occurs, the outward pull of the senses—sound, touch, sight, taste, and smell—naturally subsides, not through suppression but through the magnetism of presence. In this collected state, a delicate tingling (pipīlikā-sparśa) may arise—not as a sought-after experience, but as the somatic expression of awareness dissolving its identification with gross form.</p>
<p>At that precise moment (velāyām), when sensation is felt without the overlay of "mine," supreme bliss (paramaṃ sukham) reveals itself not as an emotional pleasure, but as the intrinsic joy of consciousness recognizing its own unbounded nature. Though it begins with attention to breath and body (āṇavopāya), at the moment of recognition it transcends method and becomes pure śāmbhavopāya—the natural abidance in what has always been present.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Extended Commentary</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>Don't think about controlling your senses—feel the space in which this text appears right now. That space is not an object; it is awareness itself, already whole, already free. This verse simply points to what is already happening when attention becomes total.</p>
<p>The "restraining of sensory currents" (<em>sarva-srotō-nibandhena</em>) is not a practice to master. It is what naturally occurs when you stop chasing experience and simply rest as the awareness that knows it. The eyes may remain open, the world still present—but your attention no longer leaks outward in grasping. This is not withdrawal from life; it is deeper participation in it.</p>
<p>The "upward movement" of breath is not literal. It is the inner orientation toward source—the same way a flame naturally rises not by effort, but by its nature. When awareness is undivided, the body becomes transparent to this movement. That tingling sensation ("ants crawling") is not proof of spiritual advancement; it is the body's natural response to unbroken presence.</p>
<p>Most importantly, "supreme bliss" is not a state to achieve. It is the quiet satisfaction of being what you are. Not the pleasure of sensation, but the recognition that sensation—however subtle—arises within you, the unchanging ground of all experience. The bliss is not in the tingling; it is in the space that holds the tingling without being touched by it.</p>
<p>This is not about producing special experiences. It is about meeting ordinary experience with total presence. When you feel the breeze on your skin, don't label it "pleasant" or "unpleasant"—let awareness rest in the sensation itself, before interpretation. In that resting, the boundary between "feeler" and "felt" dissolves, and what remains is not a state to cultivate, but the ever-present ground of being.</p>
<p>The path is not "up the spine" but "into the heart of this moment." The sensation of crawling ants is not a signpost to follow, but a mirror reflecting your own nature—luminous, responsive, and free. In that mirror, there is no path, no practitioner, no goal. Only the simple, unadorned fact: awareness is, and in its recognition, bliss is not found. It is remembered.</p>

<h3>The Space Between Fire And Poison</h3>

<p class="sanskrit-block">
वह्निविषस्य मध्ये तु चित्तं सुखमयं क्षिपेत्।<br>
केवलं वायुपूर्णं वा स्मरानन्देन युज्यते॥६८॥<br>

</p>

<div class="translation">
<p>Place the mind—overflowing with bliss—<br />
in the space between fire and poison.<br />
Or simply fill awareness entirely with breath.<br />
In either case, merge with the eternal joy of union.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Lakshmanjoo's Transmission</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>This dhāraṇā reveals the non-dual heart of all apparent opposites. "Fire" (vahni) symbolizes icchā—the upward impulse of creation, will, desire; "poison" (viṣa) represents jñāna—the downward movement of dissolution, discernment, stillness. The practitioner rests in the interval between them—not in the surge of wanting nor in the resolution of knowing, but in the silent threshold where both arise.</p>
<p>This middle ground (madhye) is not spatial but experiential: the pre-conceptual moment before perception crystallizes into thought. When mind abides here, suffused with inherent joy (sukha-mayaṃ), it recognizes its own nature as the space in which all duality plays.</p>
<p>Alternatively, one may simply saturate awareness with the natural flow of breath (vāyu-pūrṇaṃ)—not through force, but through total presence to its unbroken rhythm. In this fullness, all separation dissolves.</p>
<p>Whether through the symbolic middle or through breath's continuity, the result is the same: union with smar-ānanda—the bliss that recognizes itself. This is not an emotional state but the self-recognition of consciousness as it is: whole, unbroken, and eternally fulfilled.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Extended Commentary</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>Don't think about fire and poison—feel the space between any two opposites right now. The pause between thoughts, the stillness between heartbeats, the openness between inhale and exhale—this is the living reality of madhye.<br />
The text offers two entry points, not as techniques to master, but as mirrors reflecting the same truth. The "space between fire and poison" is the threshold where the mind surrenders its addiction to resolution. In ordinary life, we rush to name experience: "This is joy," "That is sorrow." But in the in-between, before labeling, reality shines naked and unowned.</p>
<p>The alternative path—filling awareness with breath—is not about controlling inhalation or exhalation. It's about recognizing that every breath is already whole. When you stop measuring breath as "mine," it reveals itself as the pulsation of the universe itself—unbroken, effortless, complete.</p>
<p>"Smar-ānanda" is often translated as "the bliss of recollection," but this misses its essence. It is not memory of past joy, but the ever-present joy of awareness remembering itself. In the gap between opposites, in the fullness of breath, there is no separate "you" experiencing bliss. There is only bliss—conscious, alive, free.</p>
<p>This is not sexuality, nor is it asceticism. It is the recognition that all life—whether in the heat of passion or the coolness of stillness—is already saturated with the one taste. The body may tremble, the mind may dance, but the space that holds them remains untouched, radiant, whole.</p>
<p>Try this now: feel the space between your ribs as you read these words. Don't manipulate your breath—simply sense the openness there. That space is not empty; it is full of awareness. That awareness is not yours; it is you. In that recognition, fire and poison are seen as one dance, and what remains is not an experience to attain, but the ground of all experience—already free, already whole.</p>
<p>There is no moving toward union, but stopping the movement of fragmentation. In that stop, the world is not denied—the marketplace, the kitchen, the bedchamber all become altars. But the offering is not objects; it is the surrender of the illusion that you were ever apart from what you seek.</p>
<p>And in that surrender, Bhairava is not found beyond fire or poison, beyond breath or stillness. He is the unbroken space in which all opposites arise, play, and dissolve—recognizing itself as the eternal joy that needs nothing added, nothing removed.</p>

by intensely recalling<br />
the joy of kissing, embracing, or caressing,<br />
a flood of supreme delight arises.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Lakshmanjoo's Transmission</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>These verses do not prescribe practice. They are vivid analogies—pedagogical mirrors, not methods. The sexual union (śakti-saṅgama) is used not as a spiritual technique, but as the closest human experience to the non-dual ecstasy of Śiva-Śakti merging. At the peak of mutual absorption—when personal boundaries dissolve in shared rapture—one tastes a fleeting reflection of cidānanda, the self-luminous joy of pure being.</p>
<p>Similarly, verse 70 illustrates that even the intense recollection (bharat-smṛteḥ) of such intimacy—without physical enactment—can trigger a surge of inner bliss (ānanda-samplavaḥ). This is not fantasy, but the power of remembrance (smaraṇa) to awaken the same energy that, in realization, flows unimpeded.</p>
<p>However, this is not a meditation technique in the technical sense. Abhinavagupta and other authorities cite it as metaphor, not method. The Vijñāna Bhairava itself clarifies that such references are illustrative, not instructional. Their purpose is pedagogical: to point the seeker toward the depth, immediacy, and totality of bliss by invoking the most potent experience available in ordinary life.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Extended Commentary</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>Verses 69–70 occupy a delicate threshold. They acknowledge that the human body—especially in moments of total surrender—can mirror the divine play of unity. But they do not elevate sexuality to a path. Instead, they use its intensity as a mirror: <em>This—this total loss of separation, this unguarded fullness—is a glimpse of what you truly are.</em></p>
<p>The key is <em>intensity without objectification</em>. In ordinary desire, pleasure is sought as a possession. In the metaphor of these verses, the “bliss” arises precisely when possession ends—when lovers cease to be two and become one field of sensation. That momentary collapse of duality is the echo of recognition.</p>
<p>Similarly, “recollection” (<em>smṛti</em>) is not nostalgic indulgence. It is a focused invocation of the <em>feeling-state</em> of unity—so complete that the mind forgets the image and rests in the resonance. In that resonance, the distinction between “remembering” and “being” softens.</p>
<p>Yet the text is careful: this is simile, not sadhana. The true “union” is not between bodies, but between awareness and itself. The real “kissing” is the touch of subject and object collapsing into one taste. The authentic “embrace” is the holding of all experience in the open arms of non-dual awareness.</p>
<p>Thus, these verses are not licenses, but lenses. They do not invite you to chase ecstasy, but to recognize that the deepest joy you have ever known—even in fleeting human moments—was never separate from the eternal bliss that is your own nature.</p>

<h3>Merging Into Spontaneous Joy</h3>

<p>When great joy arises—<br />
whether in profound delight<br />
or upon seeing a beloved after long separation—<br />
meditate on the very upsurge of that bliss;<br />
merging into it, the mind becomes one with it.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Lakshmanjoo's Transmission</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>This is the actual <em>dharāṇā</em> relating to the prior verses. It does not prescribe sexual union, but utilizes any intense moment of spontaneous joy—whether from intimacy, reunion, or sudden wonder—as a gateway to realization.</p>
<p>At the instant of overwhelming delight (<em>ānande mahati prāpte</em>), before the mind labels, claims, or narrates the experience, there is a pure upsurge (<em>ānandam udgatam</em>)—a flash of unconditioned bliss that is none other than the self-radiance of consciousness. The instruction is to <em>dhyātvā</em>—attend directly to that upsurge itself, not to its cause.</p>
<p>By resting in the source of the joy—not the friend, not the sensation, but the naked arising of bliss—the practitioner dissolves into it (<em>tal-layaḥ</em>) and becomes fully absorbed (<em>tan-manā bhavet</em>). This is not emotional indulgence; it is recognition: the bliss was never “yours,” but the intrinsic nature of the Self.</p>
<p>Because it relies on awareness attending to an inner event without mantra or breath, this is pure śāktopāya. The emotion is not rejected; it is seen through to its luminous core.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Extended Commentary</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>Verse 71 transforms ordinary human joy into a path of awakening. The key is timing: the moment joy <em>arises</em>, before “I am happy” solidifies into identity. In that gap—between the surge and the story—lies the door.</p>
<p>This applies universally. The embrace of a long-lost friend, the climax of passion, the awe at a sunset—all contain, for an instant, the unfiltered pulse of <em>ānanda</em>. Most miss it, rushing to possess or interpret the feeling. But here, one pauses—not to analyze, but to <em>dwell in the rising itself</em>.</p>
<p>“Merging into it” (<em>tal-layaḥ</em>) means the boundary between “me” and “joy” collapses. You do not <em>have</em> bliss; you <em>are</em> bliss—temporarily unobscured. That “you” is not the ego, but awareness prior to separation.</p>
<p>This is not about cultivating pleasure, but about recognizing that all joy—however fleeting—is a ripple from the ocean. The beloved, the body, the moment—they are not the source. The source is the silent awareness in which both longing and fulfillment appear.</p>
<p>Thus, this practice is radical inclusion: nothing is rejected, not even desire. Instead, every peak of human feeling becomes an invitation to dive beyond the wave into the depth from which it rose—and discover that you were the ocean all along.</p>

from that, supreme bliss arises.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Lakshmanjoo's Transmission</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>This dharana transforms sensory pleasure into spiritual insight. One partakes of food or drink—especially what is deeply enjoyed—and at the very moment when pleasure blooms (rasānanda-vijṛmbhaṇāt), one does not cling to the taste or the act, but rests in the feeling of fullness (bharitāvasthā) that arises with it.</p>
<p>This fullness is not physical satiety, but the expansive, uncontracted state of awareness that underlies all genuine enjoyment. The practitioner holds the conviction—not "I am enjoying," but "I am fullness itself." In that recognition, ordinary pleasure becomes a portal to mahānanda, the great bliss that is the intrinsic nature of consciousness.</p>
<p>Because it uses a sensory experience as support (jagdhi-pāna), this belongs to śāktopāya. The bliss is not rejected as worldly; it is seen as a localized expression of universal joy. The support is temporary; the recognition is eternal—what appears as enjoyment is actually the mirror reflecting your own boundless nature.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Extended Commentary</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>Verse 72 sanctifies the ordinary. Eating and drinking—daily acts often dismissed as mundane—are revealed as opportunities for awakening. The key is not what you consume, but how you meet the experience.</p>
<p>When flavor floods the senses, the mind usually narrows into craving or judgment: "This is good—I want more," or "This is gone—I miss it." But here, one pauses in the peak of delight, before desire or memory intervenes. In that pause, the joy is not "mine"; it is pure, unowned radiance.</p>
<p>"Abide in the state of fullness" means to stop identifying as a separate consumer and instead recognize: This joy is not coming from the food—it is my own nature, temporarily unveiled. The sweetness of honey, the richness of wine, the warmth of broth—all are mirrors reflecting the inherent fullness of awareness.</p>
<p>This is not hedonism, but deconstruction through delight. By meeting pleasure with total presence, its power to bind dissolves. The taste remains, but the hunger for it as a source of happiness vanishes. What emerges is not satisfaction of desire, but the end of seeking itself.</p>
<p>Thus, the kitchen becomes a temple, the meal an offering, and the act of tasting a direct recognition: every flavor is a ripple in the ocean of bliss.</p>

<h3>Music Dissolving Mind</h3>

<p class="sanskrit-block">

<p>When the yogi’s mind becomes one<br />
with the incomparable joy of music and such aesthetic delights,<br />
and is fully absorbed in that essence,<br />
he realizes identity with it.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Lakshmanjoo's Transmission</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>This dharana turns aesthetic experience into a gateway to non-dual realization. The yogi listens not to individual notes or rhythms, but to the <em>collective resonance</em> (<em>sama-saukhya</em>) that underlies all sound—the unified vibration (<em>nāda</em>) that flows through the seven svaras as one luminous stream. In that listening, the mind does not chase succession; it merges into the singular current of beauty.</p>
<p>When absorption is total (<em>manoruddheḥ</em>), and the listener becomes <em>tanmayatvena</em>—“of that very essence”—the boundary between subject and object dissolves. The yogi no longer hears music; he <em>is</em> the music, not as personal emotion, but as the self-radiant joy of consciousness itself. This is <em>tad-ātmatā</em>: identity with the Self, revealed through aesthetic rapture.</p>
<p>Because it uses sensory beauty as a support, this is śāktopāya. Yet for the mature practitioner, even ordinary conversation, poetry, or the sound of wind can trigger this recognition—provided the mind is refined enough to perceive the unity beneath multiplicity.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Extended Commentary</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>Verse 73 reveals that art is not diversion, but revelation. The “collective sound” is not the sum of notes, but the silent harmony that holds them—the same harmony that holds galaxies, breaths, and thoughts. To hear it is to hear the pulse of reality itself.</p>
<p>Most listen fragmentarily: “This note is sharp,” “That phrase is sad.” But the yogi listens with the whole being, perceiving the <em>one taste</em> beneath all variation. In that perception, the sense of “me listening” vanishes, and only listening remains—vast, unowned, and luminous.</p>
<p>Abhinavagupta’s warning is precise: those who cannot feel this unity remain <em>jada</em>—not dead, but spiritually inert—not because they lack intelligence, but because they lack the openness to be dissolved by beauty. For them, sound is noise; for the yogi, even discord reveals the underlying silence.</p>
<p>This is not reserved for concert halls. The “music” may be birdsong, rain, a lover’s voice, or the hum of traffic. What matters is not the source, but the depth of listening. When attention is total, every sound becomes a mantra, every moment a rite of recognition.</p>
<p>Thus, aesthetic joy is not escape—it is homecoming. In the heart of beauty, the yogi finds not pleasure, but the Self.</p>

<h3>Mind Finds Natural Contentment</h3>

<p class="sanskrit-block">
यत्र यत्र मनस्तुष्टिर्मनस्तत्रैव धारयेत्।<br>
तत्र तत्र परानन्दस्वरूपं सम्प्रवर्तते॥७४॥<br>
</p>

<p class="romanized-block">
yatra yatra manas-tuṣṭir manas tatraiva dhārayet |<br>
tatra tatra parānanda-svarūpaṃ sampravartate ||74||<br>
</p>

<div class="translation">
<p>Wherever the mind finds contentment,<br />
let it rest there.<br />
In that very place,<br />
the nature of supreme bliss reveals itself.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Lakshmanjoo's Transmission</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>This is the essence: Natural, effortless realization. The practitioner does not seek a “holy” place or a “spiritual” experience. Instead, wherever the mind settles spontaneously in peace—whether in the garden, at work, in silence, or amid sound—one simply abides there (<em>manas tatraiva dhārayet</em>).</p>
<p>There is no hierarchy of activities. The act that brings stillness <em>is</em> the sacred act, regardless of convention. To force attention toward a “pure” object while the mind is at ease elsewhere is not devotion—it is resistance. True worship is alignment with what already calms the mind.</p>
<p>In that alignment, without effort or projection, <em>parānanda-svarūpaṃ</em>—the very form of supreme bliss—arises not as a new state, but as the natural radiance of awareness freed from seeking. As Abhinavagupta affirms: whatever delights the mind becomes a vessel for Brahman.</p>
<p>This is śāktopāya at its most inclusive: the world itself, in its ordinary fullness, is the path.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Extended Commentary</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>Verse 74 dismantles the sacred-secular divide. Peace is not found by escaping life, but by meeting it exactly as it is. If the mind is calm while washing dishes, that sink is the altar. If stillness arises while walking in rain, that street is the temple. The location is irrelevant; what matters is the quality of presence.</p>
<p>“Let it rest there” (<em>dhārayet</em>) is not passive. It is active surrender—refusing to chase a “better” state, and instead honoring the grace already present. This requires humility: to accept that enlightenment might wear gardening gloves or typing fingers, not just prayer beads.</p>
<p>The phrase “supreme bliss reveals itself” (<em>sampravartate</em>) is key. It does not come <em>because</em> of the activity, but <em>through</em> the non-resistance to it. When the mind stops rejecting the present, the veil thins—and what shines through is not joy <em>from</em> the garden, but joy <em>as</em> the ground of the garden, the gardener, and the act itself.</p>
<p>Thus, this teaching is not permission for distraction, but an invitation to intimacy with what is. In the ordinary moment—fully embraced—lies the extraordinary truth: that bliss is not elsewhere. It is here, now, wherever the mind is at rest. And in that rest, Bhairava is not sought. He is recognized.</p>

<h3>Between Waking And Sleep</h3>

<p class="sanskrit-block">
अनागतायां निद्रायां प्राणे स्ते बह्यगोचरे।<br>
सावस्था मनसा गम्या परा देवी प्रकाशते॥७५॥<br>
</p>

<p class="romanized-block">

</p>

<div class="translation">
<p>When sleep has not yet come,<br />
and outer awareness has ceased—<br />
that state, approached by the mind,<br />
reveals the supreme Goddess.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Lakshmanjoo's Transmission</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>This dharana points to the threshold between waking and sleep—<em>anāgatā nidrā</em>, “sleep not yet arrived”—the liminal space where external perception has withdrawn (<em>bahya-gocare</em>), yet full unconsciousness has not set in. The breath is naturally suspended (<em>prāṇe ste</em>), and the mind, unanchored from sense objects, hovers in pure subjectivity.</p>
<p>To “approach this state with the mind” (<em>manasā gamyā</em>) is not to visualize or concentrate, but to rest in luminous vigilance as the world recedes. In that vigilance—free of drowsiness, free of imagery—<em>parā devī</em>, the supreme power of awareness, reveals herself not as an object, but as the self-shining ground of being.</p>
<p>This is pure śāmbhavopāya: no support, no technique, no object. It is the natural abidance in <em>turīya</em>, the fourth state, which underlies waking, dreaming, and deep sleep. Here, the body may appear asleep to others, but consciousness remains awake to itself—unmoved, unbroken, and free.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Extended Commentary</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>Verse 75 unveils one of the most accessible yet profound gateways to realization: the gap before sleep. Most slip through it unknowingly, lost in fatigue or anticipation of dreams. But the yogi meets it with wide-open awareness.</p>
<p>In that interval—after the last thought of the day, before the first dream image—there is no “me,” no world, no time. Only pure, unmediated presence. This is not unconsciousness; it is hyper-consciousness, unclouded by content. The breath often pauses spontaneously, not by force, but because the outward impulse of attention has ceased.</p>
<p>“Supreme Goddess reveals herself” means the dynamic face of the absolute—Śakti as pure knowing—shines forth not as a vision, but as the silent certainty: <em>I am</em>. There is no body, no senses, no memory—yet awareness remains, undiminished.</p>
<p>This state is not rare. It occurs nightly. The only difference is recognition. When you learn to abide there—not chasing it, not fearing it—you discover that true rest is not oblivion, but awakening. The body may lie still, but consciousness stands in its fullness: Bhairava, ever awake, ever free.</p>
<p>Thus, the threshold of sleep becomes the doorway to eternity—not by escaping life, but by meeting the moment between worlds with total presence.</p>

<h3>Radiant Space As Mirror</h3>

<div class="translation">
<p>Fix your gaze on space<br />
filled with the variegated radiance<br />
of sun or lamp.<br />
There itself,<br />
your true nature shines forth.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Lakshmanjoo's Transmission</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>This practice uses luminous space as a mirror for awareness. One gazes steadily—not at the physical source (the sun or bulb), but at the light-infused atmosphere itself (<em>ākāśe savalī-kṛte</em>). The enclosure, the fixture, the form—these are ignored. Only the pervading glow is held in attention.</p>
<p>After sustained gazing, one may close the eyes and rest in the afterimage—not as memory, but as the inner counterpart of outer radiance. In that fusion of inner and outer light, the mind, unanchored from form, dissolves into pure luminosity.</p>
<p>In that dissolution, <em>svātma-rūpam</em>—the essential form of the Self—reveals itself not as an object seen, but as the self-luminous ground that sees. Though it uses light as a support (placing it in śāktopāya), the moment identification with the light ends and only awareness remains, the practice opens into śāmbhavopāya.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Extended Commentary</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>Verse 76 works with light not as physics, but as metaphor for consciousness. The sun or lamp is incidental; what matters is the space <em>filled</em> with light—boundless, inclusive, impartial. This is the quality of awareness itself: it does not reject darkness, but reveals everything without being stained by it.</p>
<p>The instruction to “ignore the glass” is symbolic: see through form to the radiance that animates it. Whether gazing at sunlight through leaves or lamplight on a wall, the point is to let the eyes soften, the mind empty, and attention become transparent.</p>
<p>Closing the eyes afterward is not withdrawal, but integration. The outer light becomes the inner light—not as visualization, but as the natural glow of presence. In that glow, thoughts may arise, but they are seen as shadows passing through light, not as truths.</p>
<p>“Your true nature shines forth” means the Self is not discovered as new, but recognized as what has always been illuminating experience. You are not the one who sees the light—you are the light by which seeing occurs.</p>
<p>Thus, this practice is not about staring at brightness, but about becoming attuned to the ever-present clarity that is Bhairava.</p>

<h3>Fullness Through The Five Mudras</h3>

<p class="sanskrit-block">
करङ्किण्या क्रोधनाया भैरव्या लेलिहाया च।<br>
खेचर्यां दृष्टिकाले च परावाप्तिः प्रकाशते॥७७॥<br>

<p>With steady gaze in Karaṅkiṇī,<br />
in Krodhanā, Bhairavī, Lelihā—<br />
and in the sky-traveling Khecarī,<br />
supreme fullness shines forth.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Lakshmanjoo's Transmission</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>These five mudrās represent five paths to realization, each expressing non-dual awareness through a specific bodily posture.</p>
<p>Karaṅkiṇī-mudrā: For the jñāna-siddha, realized through direct insight. The body lies utterly still like a corpse, free of all movement. This is the death of self-contraction, the stillness of pure awareness.</p>
<p>Krodhanā-mudrā: For the mantra-siddha, realized through repetition. The face is fierce—eyes wide, mouth open, teeth bared—yet free of emotional turmoil. All residual energy of practice dissolves into unwavering stillness.</p>
<p>Bhairavī-mudrā: For the melāpa-siddha, realized in the threshold between sleep and waking. Eyes remain unblinkingly open; breath suspends in the pause between in and out. This is the fusion of steadfast awareness and awestruck openness—where external perception has ceased but full unconsciousness has not begun.</p>
<p>Lelihā-mudrā: For the śākta-siddha, realized through immersion in bliss. There is subtle inner tremor—not from sensation's pleasure, but from the overflow of fullness itself.</p>
<p>Khecarī-mudrā: For the śāmbhava-siddha, established in thought-free awareness. This is not merely a tongue lock, but abiding in the boundless sky of consciousness while fully engaged in life's activities—speaking, eating, working—untouched yet thoroughly present, like an actor who knows the play is not real.</p>
<p>When any of these mudrās is held with unwavering gaze (dṛṣṭi-kāle), the sense of separation dissolves. The supreme pervasion (parā-vāptiḥ) does not arise as an achievement but is recognized as what has always been. Though all five converge on the same truth, only Khecarī fully embodies śāmbhavopāya—effortless abidance in pure awareness.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Extended Commentary</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>True mastery appears not in special postures, but in how we inhabit ordinary moments. The five gestures described aren't postures to perfect, but natural expressions of awareness itself—unfolding whenever we cease struggling against experience.</p>
<p>Karaṅkiṇī's stillness isn't corpse-like rigidity—it's what your body recognizes when thought subsides. Krodhanā's fierce expression isn't anger—it's the clarity that arises when you cease editing your experience. Bhairavī's unwavering gaze isn't strain—it's the natural openness that sees both thought and the space between thoughts. Lelihā's subtle tremor isn't excitement—it's the recognition that joy exists prior to objects. Khecarī's sky-traveling isn't a physical gesture—it's the ordinary miracle of awareness present in every act, untouched yet fully engaged.</p>
<p>These states reveal what's already true: awareness has no fixed address. When we cease struggling against experience—whether in stillness, fierce presence, open-eyed receptivity, tasting life's sweetness with full attention, or moving through activities with inner spaciousness—we discover that consciousness itself is already complete.</p>
<p>Try this now: let your eyes rest softly on these words. Don't force stillness or intensity. Simply be present—unmodified, undivided. In that simple presence, without adopting any special posture, what shines is already full. This completeness isn't found by adding special techniques, but by removing the veil of separation we impose between ourselves and the living moment.</p>
<p>The ultimate gesture is the one that leaves no trace—where action flows without a sense of someone acting, where awareness recognizes itself in every gesture of existence. There can be no moving toward realization, only the ceasing of movement away from what's already here. When attention is total—whether in stillness or movement—what emerges isn't a new state, but what remains when the fiction of separation falls away. These five doorways aren't about transforming yourself. They are about recognizing that you were never bound.</p>

<h3>Unsupported Sitting</h3>

<p class="sanskrit-block">
मृद्वासने स्फिजैकेन हस्तपादौ निराश्रयम्।<br>
निधाय तत्प्रसङ्गेन परा पूर्णा मतिर्भवेत्॥७८॥<br>

<p class="romanized-block">

</p>

<div class="translation">
<p>Sit gently on a soft cushion,<br />
balanced on the sitting bones alone.<br />
Place hands and feet without support.<br />
In this simplicity,<br />
supreme fullness of awareness arises.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Lakshmanjoo's Transmission</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>This dhāraṇā reveals how physical alignment becomes direct recognition. The yogi sits on a moderately soft seat—not too firm, not too yielding—resting only on the sitting bones (<em>sphijaikena</em>). The hands and feet remain unsupported (<em>nirāśrayam</em>), neither touching floor nor knee, suspended in natural equipoise.</p>
<p>This is not about perfect posture but about releasing subtle dependencies. When no part of the body leans on anything external, the habitual spatial reference "I am here" dissolves. Without these physical anchors, awareness naturally settles into its unbounded nature (<em>parā pūrṇā matiḥ</em>).</p>
<p>Though it begins with bodily arrangement (āṇavopāya), the moment attention stabilizes in this unsupported presence, the method dissolves into pure recognition (śāmbhavopāya). The body is not a vessel to contain awareness—it becomes transparent to the awareness that animates it.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Extended Commentary</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>This verse reveals how ordinary sitting becomes sacred when freed from subtle dependencies. Don't think about perfecting your posture—feel the space in which your body appears right now.</p>
<p>The soft cushion is not luxury but wisdom: enough comfort to prevent distraction, not enough to induce dullness. The "sitting bones" instruction is not anatomical precision but an invitation to find your body's natural axis—the vertical alignment where weight and lightness meet.</p>
<p>Most crucial is the unsupported hands and feet. This is not theatrical gesture, but the dissolution of the body's habitual conversation with the world. When your hand doesn't rest on your knee, when your foot doesn't press against the floor, the subtle dialogue of "me here, world there" ceases. In that cessation, awareness is no longer pulled outward through the limbs.</p>
<p>What emerges is not emptiness but fullness. Not the emotional plenitude of happiness, but the uncontracted radiance of awareness itself—unbounded because it no longer believes it needs support. This fullness isn't found in the posture; it's recognized when the posture reveals the space in which both body and support arise.</p>
<p>Try this now as you read: let your hands rest freely in your lap, palms open, without leaning them against anything. Feel your feet on the floor but don't push down. Sense the sitting bones bearing your weight. Notice how the mind becomes less divided—not because you've achieved a special state, but because you've stopped reinforcing the subtle supports that fragment attention. The cushion is not a tool to use but a threshold to cross. When you sit without bracing, without leaning, without subtle contractions of support—what remains is not a body in space, but space appearing as body.</p>
<p>In that recognition, liberation is not something to attain by sitting correctly. It is the natural condition of being when you stop holding on—not just physically, but in the very architecture of your identity. The hands and feet are free not because they float in air, but because they are seen as expressions of the same awareness that knows them.</p>
<p>Thus, this simplest of instructions—"sit with limbs unsupported"—becomes a mirror reflecting the truth: you were never dependent on anything. The throne of awareness requires no pillars. In the very act of releasing the last support, you discover you were already seated on the unshakable ground of being—Bhairava, not beyond the body, but as the luminous space within which body and world appear as one seamless reality.</p>

<h3>Space Beneath Armpits</h3>

<p class="sanskrit-block">
उपविश्यासने सम्यक् बाहू कृत्वर्धकुञ्चितौ।<br>

<p>Sit fully balanced on a seat,<br />
arms gently bent halfway.<br />
Rest the mind in the space beneath the armpits—<br />
not as anatomical location,<br />
but as boundless openness.<br />
There, merging with what has never departed,<br />
peace arises—not as achievement,<br />
but as the natural state.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Lakshmanjoo's Transmission</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>This dhāraṇā reveals how ordinary posture becomes direct recognition. The seated position (<em>samyak āsane</em>) is neither rigid nor lax—utterly ordinary, yet completely present. The arms are held in <em>ardha-kuñcitau</em>—half-bent, not forced, creating subtle openness beneath the armpits (<em>kakṣa</em>).</p>
<p>This is not anatomical focus. The <em>kakṣa-vyoman</em>—the void beneath the arms—is not a cavity in the body, but the transparent space in which the body itself appears. When the mind is placed (<em>manaḥ kurvan</em>) there—not through concentration, but through total relaxation of effort—it discovers this space is identical to the boundless sky of awareness (<em>cid-ākāśa</em>).</p>
<p>In that recognition (<em>tal-layāt</em>), <em>śāmam</em>—peace—arises not as a state to be attained, but as the inherent stillness of consciousness freed from the subtle contraction of "I am here." Though the posture belongs to āṇavopāya, the moment awareness rests in the space itself, the method dissolves into śāktopāya. And in that dissolution, what remains is not emptiness, but fullness: Bhairava, abiding in the world while untouched by it.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Extended Commentary</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>Don't think about the armpits—feel the space beneath your own arms right now. That space is not empty; it is full of awareness. This verse reveals that liberation hides in plain sight, in the most ordinary places we never notice.</p>
<p>The "half-bent arms" (<em>ardha-kuñcitau</em>) create neither tension nor collapse. They simply allow what is already there to be seen: the openness that has never been confined by flesh or bone. This is not a technique to master; it is a mirror held up to the space that is always already present.</p>
<p>When you truly rest in the space beneath your arms—not as object, but as the open field in which sensation appears—the boundary between inner and outer dissolves. That space is not "yours." It is the same space that holds galaxies and thoughts, breath and stillness. The armpit is merely a doorway; the destination is the boundless awareness that was never located anywhere.</p>
<p>"Peace arises" (<em>śāmam āyāti</em>) not because disturbance is suppressed, but because the one who needed peace has dissolved. What remains is not a tranquil state to maintain, but the vibrant stillness that underlies all movement—the unbroken wholeness that is Bhairava.</p>
<p>This is not about bodily posture. It is about recognizing that every "gap" in experience—between breaths, between thoughts, between sensations—is the same opening through which awareness recognizes itself. The armpit is not special; it is ordinary. And in that ordinariness lies the extraordinary: the ever-present ground where the separate self forgets itself, and what remains is not emptiness as absence, but fullness without boundary.</p>
<p>Try this now: sit as you are, let your arms rest naturally, and feel the space beneath them. Don't manipulate your posture. Don't seek a special sensation. Simply rest as the awareness that knows this space. In that resting, there is no "you" finding peace. There is only peace—awake to itself.   The arms, the seat, the room—all remain as they are. But the one who sat down has vanished into the space that holds everything.</p>
<p>That space is not beneath your arms. It is what you are. And in that recognition, Bhairava is not found elsewhere. He is the unbroken openness in which all practice—and all life—naturally dissolves.</p>

<h3>Unblinking Gaze</h3>

<p class="sanskrit-block">

<div class="translation">
<p>Fix the gaze, unwavering and unblinking,<br />
on a vivid external form—<br />
and, in that very moment,<br />
let the mind become supportless;<br />
thus, swiftly, one enters Śiva.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Lakshmanjoo's Transmission</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>This dharana uses the immediate impact of beauty as a lightning path to realization. One sits before a tangible, vividly present form—a richly adorned vase, a blooming flower, or the radiant presence of a young child—and fixes the eyes on it without blinking (stabdhāṃ dṛṣṭim). The object must be real—not imagined or painted—and must emanate presence, not mere appearance.</p>
<p>The key is not in analyzing the object, but in surrendering to the bhāva—the living essence of beauty itself. In that unbroken gaze, thought ceases (nirādhāraṃ manaḥ), not through suppression, but through total captivation. The mind, no longer fragmented, becomes a mirror reflecting pure awareness.</p>
<p>In that instant of non-dual perception—where seer, seen, and seeing collapse—one enters the state of supreme consciousness, not as a destination, but as the ground already revealed. Though it begins with an external support, the moment beauty is perceived not as form but as luminous presence, the method becomes pure śāmbhavopāya: direct, instantaneous, and objectless.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Extended Commentary</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>Liberation can flash forth through the door of beauty. The instruction is precise—sthūla-rūpasya bhāvasya: "the essence of a gross form." Not the form itself, but the aliveness that makes it shine. A child's face, a lotus in full bloom, a crafted vessel—these are not objects to desire, but mirrors of the divine play.</p>
<p>"Unblinking gaze" is not physical rigidity, but total absorption—eyes open, mind empty. In that seeing, there is no "I am looking at beauty." There is only beauty, seen without separation. The moment the mind stops labeling—"this is a girl," "this is a vase"—and simply rests in the radiance, the door opens.</p>
<p>"Supportless mind" means no foothold in thought, memory, or identity. The world is not denied; it is seen so completely that the one who sees vanishes. In that vanishing, what remains is not void, but fullness: the same fullness that makes a flower unfurl or a child laugh.</p>
<p>The story of Swami Mehtab Kak illustrates this perfectly. He did not admire the girl; he was dissolved by the presence she carried. Tea was served, but he was already home—not in trance, but in recognition.</p>
<p>Thus, this practice is not about gazing at objects, but about learning to see without the filter of self. In the heart of beauty, the world does not disappear—it reveals itself as the unbroken openness in which all experience arises.</p>

<h3>Tongue Centered With Soundless "Ha"</h3>

<p class="sanskrit-block">

<div class="translation">
<p>With the mouth gently opened,<br />
place the tongue centered in its space,<br />
fix awareness there,<br />
and mentally attend to the soundless “ha” of out-breath.<br />
In that, one dissolves into peace.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Lakshmanjoo's Transmission</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>This practice belongs to āṇavopāya and uses the subtle articulation of the breath-sound “ha” as a focal point. The mouth is opened just enough internally—lips relaxed, jaw unhurried—so the oral cavity becomes a resonant chamber. The tongue rests at the center, neither touching palate nor teeth. Into this still space, the practitioner mentally utters “ha,” the exhalation sound that mirrors the natural release of breath.</p>
<p>This “ha” is not part of the <em>so’ham</em> mantra in this context. While “so’ham” pairs inhalation (“sa”) and exhalation (“ha”), here only the exhalatory “ha” is used—stripped of its inhaling counterpart—to symbolize complete dissolution into the universal. As awareness merges with this silent utterance, the mind, no longer scattered, settles into <em>śānta</em>, the appeased state of Śiva. Though it begins with breath and sound (āṇavopāya), its fulfillment is śāmbhavopāya: the spontaneous vanishing of the meditator into pure stillness.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Extended Commentary</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>Verse 81 turns the mouth into a microcosm of the cosmos. The “wide-open mouth” (<em>sphāritāsye</em>) is not a grimace, but an inner expansion—a soft opening that creates space without effort. The centered tongue becomes an axis, and the silent “ha” the vibration that dissolves the boundary between inside and out.</p>
<p>“Ha” is not merely a syllable; it is the sound of letting go. In ordinary life, we hold—opinions, breath, identity. Here, in the sanctuary of the mouth, one releases without force. The mental intoning is key: no audible sound, just the subtle inner resonance that accompanies the natural outflow of prāṇa.</p>
<p>“Dissolves into peace” (<em>śānte pralīyate</em>) does not mean unconsciousness. It is the quiet collapse of the sense of “I am doing.” The mouth remains, the breath flows, but the one who claimed them as “mine” has vanished. What remains is not emptiness, but the fullness of awareness resting in its own nature.</p>
<p>This practice is especially potent because it uses the body’s own architecture as a vessel of revelation. In the simple act of opening the mouth and intoning “ha,” the yogi enacts the great return: all movement, all identity, flowing back into the silent source from which they arose. And in that return, Bhairava is not found elsewhere—he is recognized as the peace that was always already here.</p>

The yogi—whether sitting on a seat or reclining on a bed—holds the unwavering perception that the body rests on nothing (<em>nirādhāraṃ</em>). Not on earth, not on fabric, not on breath or thought—nothing supports it. This is not denial of physical contact, but the inner recognition that all apparent support is illusory.</p>
<p>As this contemplation deepens, the mind, deprived of its usual anchors, naturally thins and dissolves (<em>manasi kṣīṇe</em>). In that dissolution—<em>kṣaṇāt</em>, in a single moment—the practitioner enters <em>kṣīṇa-daśā</em>, the state beyond mental dispositions, where the sense of individuality vanishes and only pure, unconditioned awareness remains.</p>
<p>Though it starts with intentional focus (<em>vibhāvayan</em>), the moment the mind surrenders its grip, the method transcends technique. The body may remain in posture, but consciousness abides in the boundless: Śiva, ever free.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Extended Commentary</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>Verse 82 reveals liberation in stillness, whether upright or at rest. The instruction “supportless” (<em>nirādhāraṃ</em>) is radical: it asks you to see through the very notion of ground. The chair, the bed, the earth beneath—they are all appearances within awareness, not foundations of your being.</p>
<p>This is not nihilism. It is freedom. When you stop believing the body needs something to hold it up, the contraction of “I am here” softens. The body becomes weightless, not physically, but existentially—floating in the open sky of awareness.</p>
<p>“Mind dissolves” (<em>manasi kṣīṇe</em>) does not mean unconsciousness. It is the end of the mind’s tyranny—the cessation of its constant narration, its need to locate, define, and control. In that quiet, what remains is not absence, but full presence.</p>
<p>“Instant liberation” (<em>kṣaṇāt</em>) is not hyperbole. When the last prop is relinquished—when even the subtle belief in “I am supported” drops—awakening is immediate. Not because something new arrives, but because the veil of separation is seen through.</p>
<p>Thus, this practice meets you exactly as you are—sitting, lying, awake, tired—and asks only one thing: <em>Can you rest without holding on?</em> In that letting go, Bhairava is not found elsewhere. He is the space itself—in which body, bed, and breath all appear.</p>

<h3>Stillness Amid Motion</h3>

<p class="sanskrit-block">

</p>

<div class="translation">
<p>Whether seated on a moving seat<br />
or gently swaying the body,<br />
when the mind settles into stillness,<br />
O Goddess, one attains the divine flood—<br />
the boundless sky of consciousness.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Lakshmanjoo's Transmission</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>This dharana reveals motion itself as a path to stillness. One may ride upon a moving seat (<em>calāsana</em>)—a horse, a cart, or any conveyance whose rhythm gently rocks the body—or, without such support, slowly sway the torso from side to side. The oscillation is not erratic, but smooth and unhurried (<em>sanaiḥ</em>).</p>
<p>In this gentle movement, the key is not the motion itself, but the awareness that rests <em>between</em> the movements—between the rise and fall, the left and right. The mind, instead of following the swing, abides in the neutral axis where motion originates and dissolves. In that center, agitation subsides (<em>praśānte manase bhāve</em>), and the practitioner is flooded (<em>divyaugham</em>) with <em>cid-ākāśa</em>, the luminous expanse of pure awareness.</p>
<p>Since no mantra, breath control, or visualization is involved—only the natural rhythm of movement and the alertness to its midpoint—this belongs to pure śāktopāya. The support is transient; the recognition is eternal.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Extended Commentary</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>This practice dismantles the false boundary between movement and stillness. The "moving seat" (calāsane) is not a contrived method but the recognition that all life is already in motion—walking, breathing, heartbeat—the perpetual dance of existence. When the text speaks of the body "gently swaying" (sanair vā deha-calanāt), it does not prescribe a technique, but invites attention to rhythm already present in ordinary life.</p>
<p>Crucially, stillness is not achieved through motion, nor does it arise between movements. Stillness is the ever-present ground in which motion appears—like the depth of the ocean remaining unmoved while surface waves rise and fall. The mind does not "settle into stillness" (praśānte manase) as if stillness were a destination; it recognizes itself as stillness amid all agitation.</p>
<p>The phrase "divine flood" (divyaugham) is not a state to be attained, but the natural revelation of what has never been obscured. When the subtle division between "me" and "my experience" collapses—not through effort, but through the simple absence of grasping—the luminous expanse of awareness (cid-ākāśa) is revealed not as something new, but as what has always been present beneath the surface of apparent change.</p>
<p>This is not about mastering movement to reach stillness. It is about seeing that stillness was never absent—even in the midst of motion, even in the marketplace, even in the heart of chaos. The rocking cart, the swaying body, the rhythm of breath—none of these create stillness; they reveal what has always been whole. What appears as "settling of the mind" is simply the end of the illusion that awareness was ever fragmented.</p>
<p>The divine flood is not a reward for practice. It is the recognition that you were never separate from the ocean itself—even when you appeared as a wave.</p>

<h3>Cloudless Sky Revealing</h3>

<div class="translation">
<p>Gazing steadily at the clear sky—<br />
unbroken, unwavering—<br />
with body utterly still,<br />
in that very instant, O Goddess,<br />
one becomes Bhairava himself.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Lakshmanjoo's Transmission</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>This is pure śāmbhavopāya—immediate, objectless, and effortless. One looks into a cloudless sky (<em>vimalam ākāśam</em>), not as an external object, but as the mirror of one’s own nature. The gaze is held without blinking or distraction (<em>nirantaram</em>), and the body is frozen in absolute stillness (<em>stabdhātmā</em>—literally, “the self made motionless”).</p>
<p>There is no mantra, no breath control, no conceptualization—only open-eyed abidance in boundless clarity. In that unmediated seeing, the distinction between inner and outer collapses. The sky is not “out there”; it is the very space of awareness in which both observer and observed arise.</p>
<p>At that precise moment (<em>tat-kṣaṇāt</em>), the practitioner does not “attain” Bhairava; he recognizes himself as Bhairava. The “form of Bhairava” (<em>bhairavaṃ vapuḥ</em>) is not a vision—it is the self-luminous reality that shines when all contraction ceases.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Extended Commentary</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>Verse 84 is the essence of the practice: realization through naked perception. The clear sky is not chosen for its beauty, but for its emptiness—its refusal to hold any form, yet its capacity to reveal all forms. It is the perfect symbol of awareness: vast, unmarked, and self-evident.</p>
<p>“Unbroken gaze” (<em>nirantaram dṛṣṭim</em>) means total presence—no drifting into thought, no labeling “blue,” no remembering past skies. Just seeing, without a seer. “Body utterly still” (<em>stabdhātmā</em>) is not rigidity, but the natural settling that occurs when attention is not fragmented.</p>
<p>“In that very instant” (<em>tat-kṣaṇāt</em>) is the key. There is no journey, no accumulation, no waiting. The moment perception is free from the overlay of “me” and “mine,” the sky is no longer separate—and what remains is not a person looking at sky, but sky-awareness, awake to itself.</p>
<p>This is not metaphor. It is direct seeing. When you look into the cloudless expanse and stop reinforcing the boundary between “here” and “there,” the mind’s grip loosens—and in that release, you are not <em>in</em> space. You <em>are</em> space. And that space is Bhairava.</p>

<h3>Sky Dissolved Into The Crown</h3>

<p class="sanskrit-block">
लीनं मूर्ध्नि व्यात्सर्वं भैरवत्वेन भावयेत्।<br>
तत्सर्वं भैरवाकारं तेजस्तत्त्वं समाविशेत्॥८५॥<br>

<div class="translation">
<p>Contemplate the entire sky—<br />
dissolved into the crown of your head—<br />
as the very essence of Bhairava.<br />
Then, all becomes Bhairava’s form,<br />
and one enters the radiant truth of His being.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Lakshmanjoo's Transmission</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>This dharana uses imaginative expansion to dissolve the boundary between inner and outer. One visualizes the entire sky (<em>vyāt-sarvaṃ</em>) as drawn into the cranial vault (<em>mūrdhni līnam</em>)—not as physical containment, but as the recognition that the boundless space above is identical to the space within. The skull is no longer a finite container; it becomes as vast as the cosmos itself.</p>
<p>Holding this vision, one <em>bhāvayet</em>—firmly regards it—as <em>bhairavatvena</em>, the nature of Bhairava: luminous, unbounded, and self-aware. In this unified perception, all experience—inner and outer—shines as <em>bhairavākāra</em>, the form of Bhairava. The practitioner then <em>samāviśet</em>, enters fully into <em>tejas-tattva</em>, the radiant essence of that reality.</p>
<p>Because it begins with a dual framework—the sky outside and the space within—and requires intentional visualization (<em>vikalpa</em>), this belongs to śāktopāya. It is a preparatory merging, not the spontaneous immediacy of śāmbhavopāya. Yet it serves as a powerful bridge: by expanding inner space to meet outer infinity, the sense of separation dissolves, preparing the ground for direct recognition.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Extended Commentary</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>This practice employs spatial expansion as a threshold between dualistic visualization and non-dual recognition. The invitation to draw the entire sky into the cranial vault serves not as an end, but as a strategic dismantling of perceived boundaries. The skull becomes a symbolic vessel—not containing the infinite, but revealing its illusion of containment.</p>
<p>Lakshmanjoo carefully places this method within śāktopāya, where awareness uses internal imagery as a temporary scaffold. The practitioner doesn't create unity between inner and outer space—they temporarily relax the contraction that maintains their separation. This momentary relaxation creates a crack in the architecture of duality through which spontaneous recognition may flash.</p>
<p>Crucially, the "radiant truth" (tejas-tattva) isn't entered as destination but glimpsed as the ever-present ground when conceptual barriers momentarily dissolve. The visualization of sky dissolving into crown isn't cultivation of experience but momentary suspension of the habit that divides experience.</p>
<p>When the commentary describes this as "preparatory merging," it doesn't imply linear progress toward a distant goal. Rather, it acknowledges that for minds still bound by spatial reference points, the collapse of "inside" and "outside" requires a transitional gesture—a final release of the handhold before freefall into immediacy. The sky isn't brought into the head; the illusion that they were ever separate evaporates.</p>
<p>This practice is the mind's last graceful bow before the heart's spontaneous uprising—honoring the journey while recognizing that what appears as path was always home. What remains when all visualization falls away isn't attainment, but the recognition that the sky was never outside, the head was never a container, and Bhairava was never other than this unbroken wholeness.</p>

</div>

<p class="center">Lakshmanjoo's Transmission</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p><strong>Verse 86</strong>: This practice moves through the three ordinary states—waking (<em>viśva</em>), dreaming (<em>taijas</em>), and deep sleep (<em>prajñā</em>)—recognizing each as Bhairava’s expression. Waking is <em>viśva</em>, the realm of differentiation; dreaming is <em>tejas</em>, luminous with inner light; deep sleep is <em>prajñā</em>, concentrated wisdom. By seeing all three as inseparable from one’s own consciousness, the practitioner enters <em>ananta-prakāśa</em>, the infinite radiance beyond limitation. From there, one passes through <em>brahmaloka</em>—the internal world of divine consciousness—not as a final stop, but as a threshold to <em>unmīlana samādhi</em>, where eyes are open and the world is embraced as Bhairava’s body. Though it begins as āṇavopāya (sequencing through states), it ripens into śāmbhavopāya, the natural abidance in totality.</p>
<p><strong>Verse 87</strong>: On a moonless, rain-lashed night (<em>kṛṣṇa-pakṣa</em>), with all lights extinguished, one gazes into the absolute darkness (<em>taimiraṃ rūpam</em>). The steady drumming of rain silences external noise, deepening inward focus. Here, darkness is not absence, but the form of Bhairava himself—unmanifest, all-pervading. By holding this perception without fear or conceptualization, the boundary between inner and outer dissolves. In that dissolution, one <em>eṣyati</em>—attains—not a state, but the very essence of Bhairava. This is śāktopāya, for it uses darkness as a support, yet leads to the supportless.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Extended Commentary</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p><strong>Verse 86</strong> dismantles the hierarchy of states. Waking is not superior to sleep; all are movements within one awareness. To "know Bhairava in viśva, taijas, prajñā" means seeing the same luminosity in the rustle of leaves, the flicker of a dream, and the depth of dreamless rest. This knowing is not intellectual—it is the collapse of the seeker who believed enlightenment lay beyond ordinary life.</p>
<p><em>Brahmaloka</em> is not a celestial realm, but the shift in perception where the world is recognized as divine play. It is a "pathway" only for the mind still clinging to stages. True realization leaps beyond it into <em>unmīlana</em>—eyes open, heart unguarded, dancing in the marketplace without losing the still center. The cart, train, and jet analogy clarifies the upāyas: all reach the same destination, but the depth of transformation differs. Āṇavopāya’s methodical path builds unshakable foundation; śāmbhavopāya’s immediacy risks bypassing integration. Both are grace.</p>
<p><strong>Verse 87</strong> sanctifies darkness. Modernity fears the unlit, yet here, darkness is the womb of awakening. The rain’s rhythm is not distraction—it is the pulse of the absolute, dissolving the edges of self. "Form of darkness" (<em>taimiraṃ rūpam</em>) is precise: darkness as formless form, like space holding galaxies. To "meditate long" is not duration, but depth—until the one who fears darkness realizes he <em>is</em> the darkness that holds fear.</p>
<p>Bhairava is not found by adding light, but by seeing through the illusion of separation in total blackness. The rain-washed night becomes a mirror: just as clouds veil the moon yet cannot touch its light, thoughts and forms arise within awareness but cannot stain it. In that recognition, the yogi does not "attain" Bhairava—he recognizes he was never other than the unbroken stillness beneath all storm.</p>

and hold the darkness before you.<br />

and, abiding in it, become one with it.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Lakshmanjoo's Transmission</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>Verse 87 is śāktopāya: it uses the <em>impression</em> of darkness—dense, moonless, amplified by rain’s rhythm—as a support. The practitioner perceives this darkness as Bhairava’s form (<em>taimiraṃ rūpam</em>), a tangible entry point. But if the darkness were <em>absolute</em>—no sound, no sensation, only pure void with no object to perceive—it would be śāmbhavopāya. Śāmbhavopāya requires no support; it is awareness resting in its own soundless, objectless nature. Here, the rain, the night, the act of "meditating on darkness"—all are supports, placing this in śāktopāya.</p>
<p>Verse 88 deepens this by unifying inner and outer darkness. Close the eyes softly—no pressure, no phosphenes—only the blackness of <em>kṛṣṇābham</em> before you. Hold this as Bhairava’s presence. Then, <em>abruptly</em> open the eyes into dimness. The critical test is not whether forms appear, but whether the sense of separation between inner and outer arises. If, in that instant, awareness remains undivided—whether forms are seen or not—then the dark form of Bhairava is recognized as the seamless ground of all perception. In this non-dual continuity, you <em>bhāvayaṃs tanmayo bhavet</em>: dwell and become one with Bhairava. This too is śāktopāya, for it relies on the sequence of closing, stabilizing, opening, and recognizing. Yet its fruit—non-dual perception—echoes śāmbhavopāya.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Extended Commentary</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>The distinction between verses 87 and 88 is subtle but profound. Verse 87 works with <em>external</em> darkness as a mirror; verse 88 collapses the mirror itself. The critical test in 88 is perceptual purity: if opening your eyes reveals even a shadow, the practice is incomplete. True success is when the darkness inside the eyelids and the darkness outside are indistinguishable—not as visual sameness, but as the same boundless ground.</p>
<p>The teaching that "śāmbhavopāya is soundless, supportless void" clarifies the hierarchy:<br />
- <strong>Śāktopāya</strong> (87–88): Uses darkness as a <em>symbol</em> of the absolute. The rain’s sound in 87, the act of closing/opening eyes in 88—these are skillful means.<br />
- <strong>Śāmbhavopāya</strong>: Would be sitting in absolute silence and void, where no "darkness" is perceived—only awareness, prior to all objects, even the object "darkness."</p>
<p>Yet both paths converge. In verse 88, when the practitioner no longer distinguishes inner from outer darkness, the support vanishes <em>within the practice itself</em>. The "dark form of Bhairava" is no longer a form—it is the open space in which form and formlessness arise.</p>
<p>The yogi does not reject the world of rain, night, or closed eyes, but seeing through them to the luminous void that is Bhairava.</p>

<h3>Self Shining After Sensory Impact</h3>

<p>When any sense organ<br />
is struck by impact or self-restrained,<br />
and one enters the non-dual void—<br />
there, the Self shines forth.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Lakshmanjoo's Transmission</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>This dharana uses sudden sensory interruption as a lightning path to realization. Whether an organ is struck accidentally (<em>vyāghātāt</em>)—a toe hitting a stone, an elbow knocking wood—or deliberately restrained (<em>nirodhataḥ</em>)—clenching the jaw, pressing the eyes—one does not dwell on the pain or sound, but on the <em>first instant</em> of sensation, before the mind labels it “pain,” “impact,” or “me.”</p>
<p>In that raw, pre-conceptual moment—<em>ālocana</em>, the bare perception—thought halts. The shock creates a gap where subject and object collapse into pure awareness. In that gap (<em>advaye śūnye</em>, the non-dual void), the Self (<em>ātmā</em>) reveals itself not as an object, but as the luminous ground of the sensation itself.</p>
<p>Since it uses a physical event as support—however fleeting—this belongs to śāktopāya. The shock is not the goal; it is the crack through which awareness sees itself.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Extended Commentary</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>Verse 89 transforms accident into awakening. We spend life avoiding pain, yet here, the <em>first flash</em> of impact becomes a doorway. The key is precision: not the lingering ache, but the initial spark—when nerve meets resistance and awareness flares before interpretation.</p>
<p>This is not masochism. It is radical presence. In the split second before “I am hurt” arises, there is only pure sensation—vivid, unowned, and free. That instant is <em>advaya śūnya</em>: non-dual emptiness, not as absence, but as the open space where all experience arises.</p>
<p>“Self shines forth” means the sense of separation dissolves. The toe, the stone, the sensation—they are not “mine.” They are ripples in the ocean of awareness, momentarily taking form. To rest in that ripple’s origin is to touch the ocean itself.</p>
<p>Thus, this practice meets life as it is—clumsy, abrupt, embodied—and reveals that even a stubbed toe can be a guru. The world constantly offers these cracks; most ignore them. The yogi leans in, and in that lean, Bhairava is not found elsewhere. He is the space between impact and reaction.</p>

<h3>Silent Intoning Of Primal "A"</h3>

<p class="sanskrit-block">

<p>If one silently intones the primal “a”—<br />
free of bindu and visarga—<br />
O Goddess, in that very instant<br />
the Supreme Lord,<br />
a flood of wisdom,<br />
arises.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Lakshmanjoo's Transmission</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>This dharana centers on the pure, unadorned vowel “a”—the first and most fundamental of all sounds, the seed of manifestation. One does not utter “am” (with bindu, the dot signifying nasalization) or “aḥ” (with visarga, the colon-like release), but the naked “a” alone—short, abrupt, and unsupported.</p>
<p>This is not verbal repetition, but a sudden, internal release of soundless vibration. In that instant, the mouth opens spontaneously into <em>cakita-mudrā</em>—the gesture of awe: jaw dropped, eyes wide, breath suspended. This is not theatrical; it is the body’s natural response to the shock of pure presence.</p>
<p>In that gesture, duality collapses. The “flood of wisdom” (<em>jñānaughaḥ</em>)—Paramaśiva himself—arises not from effort, but from the gap created by the unqualified “a.” Though it begins with a trace of āṇavopāya (the intentional utterance), it swiftly becomes śāktopāya: awareness alone, ignited by the primal sound.</p>
<p>Spontaneous <em>cakita-mudrā</em>—as when one sees a lion and is struck with real fear—is śāmbhavopāya. But here, the mudrā is evoked through the sound “a,” making it śāktopāya. Both converge on the same truth: the moment the mind stops, Bhairava appears.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Extended Commentary</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>Verse 90 distills mantra to its essence. The letter “a” is not a phoneme; it is the pulse of origination—the first breath of existence before division. To intone it “without bindu or visarga” is to strip away all elaboration, leaving only the raw potential from which all language, all form, emerges.</p>
<p>The resulting <em>cakita-mudrā</em>—mouth open in astonishment—is not performed; it <em>happens</em>. Like the gasp at the edge of a canyon or the pause when lightning splits the sky, it is the body’s surrender to immediacy. In that surrender, the thinker vanishes, and what remains is naked awareness: vast, unfiltered, and free.</p>
<p>“Flood of wisdom” (<em>jñānaughaḥ</em>) is not knowledge <em>about</em> reality, but reality knowing itself. It is the lion not as threat, but as pure presence—so real it stops the mind. The text’s example is precise: when you truly see the lion, there is no “me” to be afraid. Only seeing. And in that seeing, the lion walks away—not because you are fearless, but because there is no one left for it to threaten.</p>
<p>Thus, this practice is not about sound, but about silence <em>through</em> sound. The “a” is the spark that burns away the veil of separation. And in the ashes, Bhairava stands—not as other, but as the open space where sound, silence, and seeing are one.</p>

<div class="commentary">
<p>This practice directs attention to the very end of a visarga sound—such as the "ḥ" in "namaḥ" or the final release in "oṃ." One does not cling to the syllable itself, but to the subtle after-pulse that follows its utterance: the vanishing point where sound dissolves into silence.</p>
<p>Crucially, the mind must be <em>nirādhāra</em>—without any prop, free of expectation, memory, or even the trace of "I am meditating." In that bare attention, the boundary between sound and silence collapses. One does not "achieve" contact with Brahman; one <em>recognizes</em> that the silence at the edge of sound was never separate from the eternal (<em>sanātana brahma</em>).</p>
<p>Though it begins with mantra recitation (āṇavopāya), the moment awareness rests in the unsupported gap after the visarga, it becomes śāktopāya. True śāmbhavopāya is the spontaneous recognition of silence—whether following a carefully intoned mantra or a sudden bird's cry—where no distinction remains between manufactured and natural sound. All sounds are Śiva's play when heard with uncontrived awareness.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Extended Commentary</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>This practice centers on a single, precise threshold: the vanishing point where sound dissolves into silence. When intoning a syllable with visarga—the soft "ḥ" release at the end of "oṃ" or "namaḥ"—attention does not linger on the vibration itself, but rests precisely where it fades. This is not a temporal moment between sounds, but the living edge where manifestation returns to source.</p>
<p>The phrase "with a mind utterly supportless" (nirādhāreṇa cittena) is the core instruction. It means no anchor in technique, no expectation of result, no subtle identity as "one who meditates." Even the trace of "I am experiencing silence" must dissolve. In that groundless attention, the boundary between knower and known, sound and silence, collapses—not as achievement, but as recognition of what was never divided.</p>
<p>Lakshmanjoo's reference to "sounds that cannot be recited" serves not to establish hierarchy between sounds, but to illuminate the nature of pure awareness. The critical distinction is not between "manufactured" and "natural" sounds, but between attention that clings and attention that releases. Whether the sound is a carefully intoned mantra or a sudden birdcall, the practice remains the same: rest where it vanishes, with no foothold for the mind.</p>
<p>This is why the visarga—literally a "release"—is the perfect vehicle. It is not the sound itself that matters, but the surrender it embodies. In that surrender, Brahman is not "touched" as an object; the illusion of separation dissolves, revealing what never departed.</p>

<h3>The Form Of Boundless Sky</h3>

<div class="translation">
<p>Meditate on your own body<br />
as the form of boundless sky—<br />
uncontained by any direction.<br />
Then, the Power of Consciousness,<br />
free from all support,<br />
reveals her true nature.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Lakshmanjoo's Transmission</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>Here, <em>svam ātmānam</em> refers not to the individual soul, but to the physical body—reimagined not as flesh and bone, but as <em>vyomākāra</em>, the very shape of space itself. One does not merely think “my body is empty,” but perceives it as utterly void—without edges, without center, without east or west (<em>digbhir anāvṛtam</em>).</p>
<p>In this contemplation, the body ceases to be a localized object and becomes indistinguishable from the infinite <em>ākāśa</em>. As this perception stabilizes, the <em>cic-chakti</em>—the dynamic power of consciousness—no longer leans on form, direction, or identity. It becomes <em>nirāśrayā</em>, supportless. And in that unbound state, it <em>darśayet svarūpam</em>: reveals its own essence—not as an object seen, but as the self-luminous ground of all perception.</p>
<p>This is śāktopāya: it begins with intentional visualization, yet its fulfillment is the collapse of the very framework it uses. The body-as-sky is not a metaphor to cling to, but a raft to be abandoned once the shoreless ocean is recognized.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Extended Commentary</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>Verse 92 dissolves the body from within. The instruction is radical: not “lighten” the body, but <em>unmake</em> it as a container. “No sides” (<em>digbhir anāvṛtam</em>) means no reference points—no front or back, no inside or out. The body becomes a transparent field, as open as the sky at dawn.</p>
<p>This is not denial of embodiment, but liberation from its illusion of solidity. When you see your hand not as a thing, but as space appearing as hand, the contraction of “mine” relaxes. The heart is no longer a pump in a chest, but a rhythm in the vast.</p>
<p>“Power of Consciousness reveals her true nature” (<em>cic-chaktiḥ svarūpam darśayet</em>) when it stops pretending to be limited. Śakti is not <em>in</em> the body; the body is a ripple <em>in</em> Śakti. When that ripple is seen as empty, Śakti is no longer a force to be wielded—she is the open field in which all forces arise and vanish.</p>
<p>Thus, this practice is not about becoming sky. It is about recognizing that you never were anything else. The body remains, but the prison of “here” has dissolved into the boundless.</p>

<h3>The Point Of Sharp Sensation</h3>

<p class="sanskrit-block">
किंचिदङ्गं विभिद्यादौ तीक्ष्णसूच्यादिना ततः।<br>

</p>

<div class="translation">
<p>Pierce any limb<br />
with a sharp needle or instrument—<br />
then, fixing awareness precisely on that point,<br />
one enters the pure state of Bhairava.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Lakshmanjoo's Transmission</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>This dharana uses acute, localized sensation as a gateway to non-dual awareness. One pricks the flesh—finger, arm, any point—with a sharp needle (<em>tīkṣṇa-sūcyādinā</em>). The pain is not avoided or analyzed; instead, attention is gathered instantly and wholly into the raw, pre-conceptual sensation itself (<em>tatraiva cetanāṃ yuktvā</em>).</p>
<p>In that pinpoint focus, the usual sense of body as a unified whole collapses. There is no “my arm,” only the luminous intensity of the prick—so vivid it burns away the subject-object split. In that gap, <em>nirmalā gatiḥ</em>—the stainless path—opens: direct entry into Bhairava’s state, unmediated by thought or identity.</p>
<p>Though the act of piercing belongs to āṇavopāya (physical intervention), the immediate, non-conceptual focus on the raw sensation—before the mind labels it “pain” or “me”—functions as a threshold that <em>anticipates</em> the immediacy of śāmbhavopāya. The pain is not the goal; it is the lens that focuses consciousness to a singularity, beyond which lies pure subjectivity.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Extended Commentary</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>Verse 93 is not advocacy of pain, but a radical harnessing of immediacy. The needle’s prick is chosen for its precision: it creates a single, undeniable point of sensation that cannot be ignored. Unlike dull ache or diffuse tension, this sharpness demands total presence.</p>
<p>“Fixing awareness on that point” (<em>tatraiva cetanāṃ yuktvā</em>) is not endurance—it is surrender to the sensation before the mind names it “pain” or “me.” In that pre-reflective instant, the body is forgotten; only awareness remains, wide awake in the flash of intensity.</p>
<p>This is <em>sthūla-paśyantī</em>: the level where sensory experience still has form (<em>sthūla</em>), yet is perceived with the directness of intuition (<em>paśyantī</em>). It is the threshold where śāmbhavopāya can flash forth even through physical means. The purity (<em>nirmalā gatiḥ</em>) arises not from the needle, but from the mind’s total non-resistance to what is.</p>
<p>Thus, this practice meets suffering not as obstacle, but as revelation. The prick is merely a catalyst; the real alchemy is the mind’s willingness to rest in raw experience without flinching. And in that rest, Bhairava is not found in relief from pain—but in the space where pain, self, and separation all dissolve into luminous presence.</p>

<h3>Denying Inner Instruments</h3>

</p>

<div class="translation">
<p>Hold the firm conviction:<br />
“There is no inner instrument—<br />
mind, intellect, or ego—within me.”<br />
Through this absence of conceptualization,<br />
one becomes utterly free from all thoughts.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Lakshmanjoo's Transmission</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>This dharana employs radical negation as a means to still the inner machinery of identification. The practitioner does not suppress the mind, but <em>denies its very existence</em> as a real, substantial entity within. “There is no <em>antaḥkaraṇa</em>—no mind (<em>citta</em>), intellect (<em>buddhi</em>), or ego (<em>ahaṃkāra</em>) inside me.” This is not denial of experience, but of the presumed <em>owner</em> of experience.</p>
<p>By holding this conviction (<em>bhāvayed iti</em>) with unwavering focus, the habitual functioning of these three faculties ceases—not through force, but through lack of belief. Without the foundational assumption “I have a mind,” thoughts lose their anchor. In that groundlessness, <em>vikalpaiḥ ujjhitaḥ</em>—freed from all mental constructs—one abides in the natural state of śāmbhava, thought-free and self-luminous.</p>
<p>Though it begins as deliberate imagination (placing it in śāktopāya), the moment the inner organs are seen as non-existent, the practice reveals its true nature: the spontaneous recognition of awareness prior to all inner division.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Extended Commentary</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>Verse 94 cuts to the root of suffering: the belief in a separate, internal “me” that thinks, chooses, and suffers. The <em>antaḥkaraṇa</em>—the triad of mind, intellect, ego—is not rejected as unreal, but <em>disowned</em>. You do not say “my mind is quiet”; you say “there is no mind here at all.”</p>
<p>This is not nihilism. It is liberation through deconstruction. When you stop feeding the idea that “I am the thinker,” thoughts may still arise, but they float like clouds in empty sky—unclaimed, unowned, powerless to bind. The “super-mind” (as the commentary calls it) is not a higher intellect, but awareness itself—the silent witness that was never part of the inner apparatus.</p>
<p>“Absence of conceptualization” (<em>vikalpānām abhāvena</em>) is key. It is not blankness, but the end of the mind’s tyranny—the cessation of its endless commentary, its need to label, judge, and possess. Thus, this practice is not about emptying the mind, but about seeing through the illusion that there ever was a container to empty. And in that seeing, Bhairava is not attained. He is recognized as the space in which all notions of “me” and “my mind” arise—and vanish—like mist in morning sun.</p>

<h3>Veils Of Limitation</h3>

<p class="sanskrit-block">
माया विमोहिनी नाम कलायाः कलनां स्थितम्।<br>

<p class="romanized-block">
māyā vimohinī nāma kalāyāḥ kalanaṃ sthitam |<br>
ityādi dharmaṃ tattvānāṃ kalayan na pṛthag bhavet ||95||<br>
</p>

<div class="translation">
<p>“Māyā is the power of delusion;<br />
the function of Kalā is fragmentation”—<br />
contemplating the inherent nature<br />
of each limiting principle,<br />
one remains undivided from the whole.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Lakshmanjoo's Transmission</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>This dharana works through discriminative insight into the <em>kañcukas</em>—the five constrictive veils (Kalā, Vidyā, Rāga, Kāla, Niyati) and Māyā, the sixth, which binds the infinite Self into the illusion of finitude. The practitioner reflects: “Māyā’s nature is to delude; Kalā’s is to fragment; Vidyā limits knowledge; Rāga binds through desire; Kāla confines in time; Niyati enforces causality. These are their intrinsic functions—but they have nothing to do with <em>me</em>.”</p>
<p>By firmly holding this understanding (<em>kalayan</em>), one does not reject these tattvas, but refuses identification with them. In that non-attachment, the sense of separation (<em>pṛthag bhavet</em>) dissolves—not because the veils vanish, but because the Self is recognized as untouched by them. This is śāktopāya: the power of discernment itself becomes the liberating force.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Extended Commentary</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>Verse 95 is a masterstroke of non-dual deconstruction. It does not ask you to destroy Māyā or the <em>kañcukas</em>—impossible, for they are divine functions of Śiva’s freedom. Instead, it invites you to <em>disidentify</em>.</p>
<p>Māyā is not evil; it is the creative power that makes the One appear as many. Kalā is not a flaw; it is the grace that allows the infinite to play at being finite. But the error is not in their existence—it is in the belief “I am this limited being shaped by them.”</p>
<p>The phrase “contemplating the inherent nature” (<em>ityādi dharmaṃ tattvānāṃ kalayan</em>) is precise. It means seeing these principles <em>as they are</em>: impersonal, automatic, and transient. Like weather passing through sky, they move through awareness but cannot stain it.</p>
<p>“One remains undivided” (<em>na pṛthag bhavet</em>) is the fruit. When you stop claiming Māyā’s dream as your reality, the dream loses its power to bind. You are not <em>in</em> the veils—you are the space in which they arise.</p>
<p>Thus, this practice is not renunciation, but reclamation. By seeing through the machinery of limitation, you reclaim your native freedom: Bhairava, ever whole, ever free—playing in the world, yet never touched by it.</p>

<h3>Desire's Point Of Arising</h3>

<p class="sanskrit-block">
जाग्रतीच्छां समुत्पन्नामवलोक्य शमं नयेत्।<br>
यत एव समुद्भूता ततस्तत्रैव लीयते॥९६॥<br>

<p class="romanized-block">
jāgrat-icchāṃ samutpannām avalokya śamaṃ nayet |<br>
yata eva samudbhūtā tatas tatraiva līyate ||96||<br>
</p>

<div class="translation">
<p>When a desire arises while awake,<br />
observe it the moment it springs—<br />
then gently dissolve it.<br />
From the very point of its arising,<br />
there it merges back into stillness.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Lakshmanjoo's Transmission</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>This dharana addresses desire not through suppression or indulgence, but through immediate, non-reactive awareness. The moment a desire (<em>icchā</em>) stirs in the mind—before it gathers momentum, before it names its object—one <em>avalokya</em> (looks directly at it) without judgment, without following its pull. In that clear seeing, one <em>nayet śamaṃ</em>—guides it into quietude, not by force, but by withdrawing the attention that feeds it.</p>
<p>Because the desire is met at its source—<em>yata eva samudbhūtā</em>—it dissolves back into the awareness from which it arose (<em>tatraiva līyate</em>). No residue remains. This is not repression; it is alchemical reversal: the energy of desire is returned to its origin before it crystallizes into thought or action.</p>
<p>Though it involves an act of witnessing (placing it in śāktopāya), the moment awareness rests at the threshold of emergence—before vikalpa arises—it becomes śāmbhavopāya. This is the essence of <em>icchopāya</em>: mastery through the instantaneous recognition of will before it becomes willful.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Extended Commentary</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>Verse 96 is a precise surgical strike at the root of bondage. Desire is not the enemy; unconscious identification with it is. The instruction is not “stop wanting,” but “see wanting as it is born.”</p>
<p>The critical instant is <em>jāgrat-icchāṃ samutpannām</em>—“a desire arising while awake.” This is not dream or fantasy, but the live spark of impulse in ordinary awareness. Most miss it, already lost in the narrative of fulfillment or denial. The yogi, however, intercepts it <em>at the threshold</em>—the split second between potential and actual.</p>
<p>“Dissolve it” (<em>śamaṃ nayet</em>) does not mean crush it. It means <em>cease to energize it</em>. Like a flame deprived of oxygen, desire extinguishes itself when not fed by attention. And because it never left its source, it returns there seamlessly—like a wave realizing it is ocean.</p>
<p>This is śāmbhavopāya in action: no mantra, no breath, no visualization—only the lightning clarity of presence. The state that arises is not emptiness, but <em>icchā-śūnya</em>: desirelessness not as absence, but as the fullness of uncontracted will.</p>
<p>Thus, this practice is not about becoming desireless, but about becoming so utterly present that desire loses its power to divide. In that presence, Bhairava is not opposed to desire—he is the silent space in which desire arises, dances, and dissolves, untouched.</p>

<h3>Prior To Will And Knowledge</h3>

<p class="sanskrit-block">

<div class="translation">
<p>“When neither my will nor my knowing has arisen—<br />
then, who am I?<br />
In truth, I am this!”<br />
Abiding as such, one dissolves into it,<br />
and the mind becomes one with that.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Lakshmanjoo's Transmission</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>This dharana unfolds as an inquiry into the ground of being prior to all activity. The practitioner asks: <em>When desire (icchā) and cognition (jñāna) are absent—before the mind names, chooses, or seeks—who is present?</em> This is not a philosophical question, but a direct turning of awareness toward its own source.</p>
<p>The answer is not conceptual: <em>“In truth, I am this!”</em> (<em>tattvato ’haṃ tathā bhūtaḥ</em>)—“this” being the silent, unqualified presence that remains when will and knowledge subside. One then <em>abides as that</em> (<em>tal-līnaḥ</em>), allowing the mind to merge completely into this pre-reflective awareness.</p>
<p>Though it begins with self-inquiry (placing it in śāktopāya), the moment attention rests in the “who” before “I,” the method reveals its true nature: śāmbhavopāya. The dissolution of individuality (<em>asmi</em>) is not annihilation, but the recognition that the “I” was never separate from the whole.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Extended Commentary</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>Verse 97 strips identity to its naked core. It does not deny desire or knowledge as functions—they arise and vanish in awareness, like waves on ocean. But it exposes the error of identification: the belief that “I am the one who wants” or “I am the knower.”</p>
<p>The question <em>“kas-tadāsmi?”</em>—“then, who am I?”—is not seeking an answer. It is a gesture of surrender: stopping all projection and resting in the open space before self-definition. In that space, there is no “me” composed of wants, beliefs, or memories—only awareness, unmodified and free.</p>
<p>“Dissolves into it” (<em>tal-līnaḥ</em>) means the boundary between inquirer and inquiry vanishes. The mind does not “go” to stillness; it recognizes itself as stillness. What is called “individual consciousness” was only a ripple of thought mistaken for the ocean.</p>
<p>Thus, this practice is not about achieving a state beyond desire and knowledge. It is about seeing that you were never bound by them. The “I” that sought liberation was the very veil—and in the instant it is seen through, Bhairava shines not as other, but as the silent “I am” beneath all names.</p>

<h3>Emergence Of Will Or Knowledge</h3>

with undivided awareness rooted in the Self.<br />
Then, the true essence of Reality is revealed.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Lakshmanjoo's Transmission</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>This dharana complements the previous verse by addressing the moment <em>after</em> desire or cognition has stirred. One does not wait for full manifestation, but meets the impulse at its very inception—<em>jāte</em>, “as it arises.” Attention is placed not on the content of desire or thought, but on the <em>point of origin</em> itself: the threshold where potential becomes actual.</p>
<p>This focus must be <em>ātma-buddhy-ananya-cetaḥ</em>—with awareness that is one-pointed, unfragmented, and anchored in the Self (<em>ātma-buddhi</em>). There is no observer separate from the observed; awareness rests in the flash of arising without commentary. In that non-dual seeing, <em>tattvārtha-darśanam</em>—direct vision of reality’s essence—dawns not as concept, but as self-evident presence.</p>
<p>Though it uses a focal point (placing it in śāktopāya), the immediacy of attending to the <em>first spark</em> of icchā or jñāna—before vikalpa crystallizes—makes it brush against śāmbhavopāya. The practitioner chooses <em>one</em> stream—desire <em>or</em> knowledge—not both, to avoid fragmentation of attention. This is <em>prathama-bhāsa</em>, the first glimmer before full manifestation.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Extended Commentary</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>Verse 98 is the art of interception. While verse 97 rests in the silence <em>before</em> will and knowledge, this verse engages the instant they <em>begin</em> to emerge. The key is timing: not after the thought has unfolded, but at the live wire of its birth.</p>
<p>“Fix the mind at their point of emergence” means attending to the <em>energy</em> of arising, not the object it seeks. When desire stirs, you do not ask “What do I want?” but feel the raw pulse of wanting itself. When cognition flickers, you do not follow the thought, but rest in the luminosity that precedes it.</p>
<p>This is not analysis—it is <em>witnessing without distance</em>. The phrase “undivided awareness rooted in the Self” (<em>ātma-buddhy-ananya-cetaḥ</em>) clarifies: awareness does not stand apart from the impulse; it <em>is</em> the space in which the impulse appears. Like a mirror reflecting a flame without being burned, consciousness holds the spark of icchā or jñāna without being claimed by it.</p>
<p>“True essence of Reality” (<em>tattvārtha-darśanam</em>) is not a new insight. It is the collapse of the illusion that will and knowledge are separate from awareness. In that collapse, Bhairava is not found beyond desire or thought—he is recognized as the unchanging ground from which they arise, play, and vanish.</p>
<p>Thus, this practice is not about controlling the mind, but about becoming so intimate with its movements that the boundary between seer and seen dissolves—and what remains is freedom, even in the midst of wanting or knowing.</p>

<h3>Knowing As Rootless Illusion</h3>

<p class="sanskrit-block">

<p>All knowing arises without cause,<br />
without support, and is illusion.<br />
In truth, it belongs to no one—<br />
thus abiding, O Beloved, one becomes Śiva.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Lakshmanjoo's Transmission</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>This dharana exposes the rootless nature of ordinary cognition (<em>jñāna</em>). The knowing of objects—of “this” and “that”—is <em>nirnimittaṃ</em> (causeless), <em>nirādhāraṃ</em> (supportless), and <em>bhramātmakaṃ</em> (deceptive). It appears to arise, yet has no true origin; it seems real, yet rests on nothing.</p>
<p>The illusion stems from the false subject: the limited “I” (<em>ahaṃ</em>) that believes it knows. In truth, there is no knower and no known—only the play of awareness projecting and reabsorbing forms. When one recognizes that <em>this knowing belongs to no one</em> (<em>kasyacin na etat</em>), the entire edifice of objectivity collapses.</p>
<p>In that collapse, one <em>becomes Śiva</em> (<em>evaṃbhūtaḥ śivaḥ</em>)—not by attainment, but by the recognition that one was never separate from the unconditioned awareness in which all apparent knowing floats like foam on ocean.</p>
<p>Though it begins with discernment (placing it in śāktopāya), the moment the illusory nature of objective knowledge is seen through, the practitioner rests in the natural state where Śiva and Śakti are one.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Extended Commentary</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>Verse 99 is a direct dismantling of epistemology. Ordinary “knowledge”—the cognition of objects, thoughts, sensations—is revealed as a mirage. It has no inherent cause (<em>nirnimittaṃ</em>): no thought arises because it “should,” no perception exists because it is “true.” It is <em>nirādhāraṃ</em>: unsupported by any ultimate reality, like a dream within a dream. And thus, it is <em>bhramātmakaṃ</em>: fundamentally mistaken, mistaking appearance for essence.</p>
<p>The crucial insight is <em>“it belongs to no one.”</em> The belief “I know this” is the knot of bondage. But who is this “I”? The limited ego has no substance; it is a ripple in awareness, mistakenly claiming ownership of the waves. When that claim is seen as empty, knowing does not cease—yet it is no longer “mine.” It simply <em>is</em>, like sunlight on water: vivid, transient, unowned.</p>
<p>This is not Vedāntic negation of the world. Here, even the <em>subject</em>—the “I” that Vedānta often retains as witness—is dissolved into universal I-consciousness (<em>aham-vimarsa</em>), the dynamic self-recognition of Śiva. The world is not unreal; it is <em>real as Śiva</em>, not as separate object.</p>
<p>“Thus abiding” (<em>evaṃbhūtaḥ</em>) means living in this recognition—not as a state to maintain, but as the natural condition when illusion is seen through. The marketplace, the breath, the thought—all are transparent to the one reality: Bhairava, ever free, ever whole.</p>
<p>This is śāktopāya because it uses discernment as a tool. But the moment discernment reveals its own groundlessness, the tool drops—and what remains is Śiva, not as other, but as your own unbroken heart.</p>

The essential nature (<em>dharma</em>) of every being—from the tiniest insect to Brahmā, the cosmic architect—is <em>cit</em>, pure Consciousness. There is no hierarchy, no gradation: the same luminous awareness shines in a blade of grass and in the sun.</p>
<p>When the practitioner <em>bhāvayan</em>—holds the firm conviction—that all forms are saturated with this one Consciousness (<em>tan-mayaṃ sarvaṃ</em>), the illusion of separation collapses. The world of duality (<em>bhava</em>)—the realm of birth, death, and otherness—is not destroyed, but seen through. In that seeing, one <em>bhavajit</em>—conquers becoming—not by escaping it, but by recognizing it as the play of the One.</p>
<p>This is śāktopāya: the power of recognition (<em>bhāvanā</em>) alone dissolves the veil of multiplicity. The method uses the perception of unity as a support, but its fruit is the spontaneous abidance where all is Śiva.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Extended Commentary</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>Verse 100 is the heart of advaitic vision. It does not say “all beings have consciousness,” but “all <em>are</em> consciousness”—not as attribute, but as essence. The ant does not “possess” awareness; it <em>is</em> awareness appearing as ant. Brahmā is not “filled with” cit; he <em>is</em> cit appearing as cosmic order.</p>
<p>“Without distinction anywhere” (<em>viśeṣo nāsti kutracit</em>) is absolute. No form is closer to truth than another. The sacred and profane, pure and impure, are equal expressions of the same ground. This is not egalitarianism—it is the collapse of comparison itself.</p>
<p>To “contemplate all as That” (<em>tan-mayaṃ sarvaṃ bhāvayan</em>) is not idealism. It is lived perception: seeing the street dog and the sage as equally luminous, not because they are the same in form, but because form is transparent to the awareness that animates both.</p>
<p>“Conquers the world of becoming” (<em>bhavajij janaḥ</em>) means liberation within life. The cycle of <em>bhava</em>—the endless chase for fulfillment in form—ends not when forms vanish, but when they are seen as expressions of the formless. The yogi walks in the world, but the world no longer binds, for every face is recognized as the face of Bhairava.</p>
<p>Thus, this practice is not withdrawal, but total inclusion. In the ordinary act of seeing—truly seeing—the world becomes a mirror of the infinite. And in that mirror, there is no “me” apart from the all—only the one taste of reality.</p>

<h3>Unwavering Stillness Amid Turbulence</h3>

<p class="sanskrit-block">

<p>When desire, anger, greed, delusion,<br />
arrogance, or envy arise,<br />
steady the intellect in unwavering stillness—<br />
and only That Reality remains.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Lakshmanjoo's Transmission</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>This dharana confronts the most turbulent states of mind not by suppression or escape, but by immediate, unshaken presence. When kāma (desire), krodha (anger), lobha (greed), moha (delusion), mada (arrogance), or mātsarya (envy) surge—precisely at their incipient rise—one does not resist, analyze, or identify with them. Instead, the buddhi (intellect, or discerning awareness) is held <em>nistimitām</em>—motionless, like a calm sea beneath storm winds.</p>
<p>This is not passivity, but radical non-participation. The emotion may rage, but awareness remains untouched, anchored in its own nature. In that stillness, the emotion loses its power to bind, for it is no longer fed by the sense of “I am angry” or “I am envious.” Stripped of ownership, it reveals itself as raw energy—nothing but the pulsation of Consciousness itself.</p>
<p>Thus, <em>tat tattvam avaśiṣyate</em>—only That Reality remains: Śiva, unmodified, ever free. Because this practice occurs at the very threshold of arising—before vikalpa crystallizes into narrative—it belongs to śāmbhavopāya: instantaneous, objectless, and thought-free.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Extended Commentary</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>It does not ask the yogi to avoid emotional storms, but to stand in their eye. The key is <em>timing</em>: the moment anger <em>begins</em> to rise—not after it has possessed the mind. Like a skilled sailor who senses the wind shift before the wave forms, the practitioner meets the impulse at its source.</p>
<p>“Steady the intellect in unwavering stillness” (<em>buddhiṃ nistimitāṃ kṛtvā</em>) means no inner commentary: no “This is wrong,” no “I shouldn’t feel this,” no strategizing. Just pure, open witnessing—like space holding thunder. In that holding, the emotion is not denied; it is <em>seen through</em>.</p>
<p>The six afflictions—kāma, krodha, lobha, moha, mada, mātsarya—are not enemies. They are Shakti in disguise: the very energy of the absolute appearing as disturbance. When met with total presence, their heat becomes the fire of wisdom.</p>
<p>“This is śāmbhavopāya” because no support is used—not breath, not mantra, not visualization. Only naked awareness, before thought divides “me” from “my anger.” In that split-second of pure seeing, the storm reveals its true nature: not chaos, but the dance of Bhairava.</p>
<p>Thus, liberation is not freedom <em>from</em> emotion, but freedom <em>within</em> it. The ocean is not troubled by its waves; the saint is not diminished by passion. And in that unbroken stillness, even wrath becomes a doorway—because what remains, always, is the one Reality.</p>

<h3>Divine Illusion Or Ceaseless Flow</h3>

<p class="sanskrit-block">

</p>

<div class="translation">
<p>Contemplate the entire universe<br />
as a magician’s illusion,<br />
or as a masterfully painted scene,<br />
or as a ceaseless flow of movement—<br />
gazing thus, bliss spontaneously arises.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Lakshmanjoo's Transmission</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>This dharana reveals the world not as illusion to be rejected, but as divine play to be seen through. The universe is <em>indrajālamayam</em>—like a magician’s trick—where the Great Magician, Bhairava himself, projects multiplicity from unity. It is <em>nyastaṃ citrakarmavat</em>—a painting placed before us—not as deception, but as the spontaneous expression (<em>vikāsa</em>) of Śiva’s sovereign freedom (<em>svātantrya</em>). Or it is <em>bhramat</em>—perpetually in motion—like a cinematic flow where beings shift from childhood to death, birth to rebirth, without ever ceasing to be the one reality.</p>
<p>When one <em>dhyāyataḥ</em> (contemplates) and <em>paśyataḥ</em> (sees) the world thus—not as solid and separate, but as transparent play—the heart opens into <em>sukho udgamaḥ</em>, the spontaneous upwelling of bliss. This belongs to śāktopāya because it begins with deliberate contemplation (<em>dhyāna</em>) before blossoming into direct perception (<em>sākṣātkāra</em>). True bliss arises not from denying the world, but from recognizing its divine nature.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Extended Commentary</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>Verse 102 transforms perception itself into liberation. The "magician’s illusion" is not a metaphor for falsehood, but for transparency. Just as a painting holds no substance apart from the canvas, the world holds no reality apart from consciousness. When you see a sunset, you do not mistake the colors for independent entities—you know them as light playing on atmosphere. So too, all forms—mountains, emotions, galaxies—are luminous vibrations in the one field of awareness.</p>
<p>Ceaseless motion (<em>bhramat</em>) reveals impermanence not as loss, but as the very rhythm of freedom. Nothing is fixed: the child becomes the elder, the seed becomes the tree, the thought becomes the silence. This ceaseless flow is not chaos; it is the rhythm of the absolute dancing in time. To see this is to relax the grip of "mine" and "not mine"—the root of sorrow.</p>
<p>"Bliss arises" (<em>sukho udgamaḥ</em>) not because suffering vanishes, but because its sting dissolves in recognition. When anger arises, it is not "my anger," but energy appearing as anger. When joy comes, it is not "my joy," but the universe celebrating itself. This is not detachment—it is full participation without ownership.</p>
<p>The practice is simple: look at anything—a crowded street, a stormy sky, your own breath—and see it as <em>indrajāla</em>: shimmering, insubstantial, yet vividly alive. In that seeing, the world does not disappear. It becomes a sacrament. And in that sacrament, Bhairava is not hidden. He is the very aliveness of the dance.</p>

<h3>Between Suffering And Pleasure</h3>

<p class="sanskrit-block">
न चित्तं निक्षिपेद्दुःखे न सुखे वा परिक्षिपेत्।<br>
भैरवि ज्ञायतां मध्ये किं तत्त्वमवशिष्यते॥१०३॥<br>
</p>

<p class="romanized-block">
na cittaṃ nikṣiped duḥkhe na sukhe vā parikṣipet |<br>

</p>

<div class="translation">
<p>Let the mind not settle in suffering,<br />
nor scatter itself in pleasure.<br />
O Bhairavī, know the middle—<br />
what Reality then remains?</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Lakshmanjoo's Transmission</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>This dharana instructs the practitioner to avoid the dual extremes of pain (<em>duḥkha</em>) and pleasure (<em>sukha</em>). The mind habitually clings to one or recoils from the other, but both are movements within duality. True freedom lies in the <em>madhye</em>—the neutral axis between them.</p>
<p>This “middle” is not a midpoint in time or sensation, but the gap where neither pain nor pleasure holds sway—where the mind is neither contracted in aversion nor expanded in attachment. It is the still point between the push and pull of experience.</p>
<p>By turning awareness to this center (<em>jñāyatāṃ madhye</em>), the practitioner does not suppress feeling, but ceases to identify with it. In that non-identification, the question arises: <em>What remains when both pleasure and pain are seen through?</em> And in that question, <em>kiṃ tattvam avaśiṣyate</em>—only That Reality is left: Śiva, unmodified by affect.</p>
<p>Though it begins with intentional focus (placing it in śāktopāya), the moment awareness rests in the gap, the method reveals its true nature: the spontaneous abidance of śāmbhavopāya.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Extended Commentary</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>Verse 103 cuts through the cycle of emotional reactivity. We spend life chasing pleasure and avoiding pain, yet both bind equally—pleasure through hope, pain through fear. The “middle” is not indifference; it is full presence without ownership.</p>
<p>When pain arises, do not become the sufferer. When joy comes, do not become the enjoyer. Rest instead in the space <em>between</em> identification and rejection—the silent witness that holds both without being stained. This is not passivity, but radical freedom: the ability to feel fully without being defined by what is felt.</p>
<p>“Know the middle” (<em>jñāyatāṃ madhye</em>) is a call to constant vigilance. It is not a state to achieve, but a stance to embody—again and again, as the commentary insists, even across lifetimes. The moment you notice the mind leaning toward sorrow or elation, gently return to the axis.</p>
<p>“What Reality remains?” is not a riddle. It is an invitation to discover that beneath all emotion, there is only awareness—luminous, boundless, and free. In that discovery, Bhairava is not found beyond feeling. He is the stillness within which all feeling arises, dances, and dissolves.</p>

<h3>Beyond Body Identification</h3>

<p class="sanskrit-block">
विहाय निजदेहस्थं सर्वत्रास्मीति भावयन्।<br>
दृढेन मनसा दृष्ट्या नान्यैक्षिण्य सुखी भवेत्॥१०४॥<br>
</p>

<div class="translation">
<p>After relinquishing identification with the body,<br />
firmly hold the conviction: “I am everywhere.”<br />
With unwavering mind and undivided gaze,<br />
one becomes bliss itself.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Extended Commentary</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>Verse 104 invites direct collapse of the boundary between self and world. It does not ask you to imagine “I am everywhere” as poetic fancy, but to <em>unlearn</em> the contraction that places awareness inside a skin-bound form.</p>
<p>“Relinquishing identification with the body” (<em>vihāya nija-dehastham</em>) is not rejection of embodiment; it is the simple seeing that awareness was never <em>contained</em> by form. The body remains, but the belief “I am this” drops away—not through effort, but through the clarity that no sensation, no limb, no breath was ever truly “mine.”</p>
<p>“I am everywhere” (<em>sarvatrāsmi</em>) is not inflation of ego, but dissolution of it. It is the recognition that the same luminosity seeing through your eyes is seeing through all eyes—that the awareness reading these words is the very life of the cosmos.</p>
<p>“Undivided gaze” (<em>nānyai-kṣiṇyā dṛṣṭyā</em>) means no split between seer and seen, inside and out. When perception is no longer claimed by a center, the world is not “out there”—it is the pulsation of your own being.</p>
<p>In that unbroken continuity, bliss is not an emotion—it is the natural resonance of awareness free from the friction of separation. And in that freedom, Bhairava is not found elsewhere. He is the space that holds all bodies as one.</p>

Contemplating thus the omnipresent Reality,<br />
one becomes all-pervading.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Lakshmanjoo's Transmission</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>This dharana dissolves the boundary between subject and object. The practitioner reflects: <em>The awareness that perceives this pot—is it truly “mine”? The desire to use it—is it located only in my mind?</em> In truth, consciousness is not a private possession. It is universal—already present in the pot, the bottle, the sky.</p>
<p>If consciousness were only “inside,” how could the pot appear in a dream when the physical object is absent? Its appearance proves that both object and subject arise within one field. The separation is illusion (<em>indrajāla</em>)—the divine play of the Magician.</p>
<p>By firmly holding (<em>bhāvayan</em>) this insight—that cognition and will are not personal but omnipresent (<em>sarvagataṃ</em>)—the sense of being a localized self collapses. One does not “attain” pervasion; one <em>recognizes</em> oneself as <em>sarvagaḥ</em>: all-pervading, like space.</p>
<p>Though it uses reflective contemplation (placing it in śāktopāya), the moment duality between “me” and “the pot” is seen through, the practice reveals the non-dual truth of Śaivism: <em>eka pramātā viśva-pramātā</em>—the one knower is the universal knower.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Extended Commentary</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>Verse 105 is a direct strike at the root of alienation. The belief “I am here, the world is out there” is the primal contraction. This verse undoes it by revealing that the pot is not <em>outside</em> awareness—it <em>is</em> awareness appearing as pot.</p>
<p>The example of dreaming is key. In sleep, the pot reappears without its physical counterpart. This shows the pot was never truly “external”—it was always a modulation of consciousness. The waking world is no different: a dream with shared rules.</p>
<p>“Spectacles are the bottle, the bottle is the spectacles” is not metaphor. It is ontological equality: all forms are transient expressions of the same ground. The name and function differ, but the substance—cit—does not.</p>
<p>To “become all-pervading” (<em>sarvagaḥ</em>) is not to expand the self, but to see that the self was never small. When you no longer claim awareness as “mine,” you discover it as the open field in which galaxies and grains of sand arise equally.</p>
<p>Thus, this practice is not philosophy—it is lived deconstruction. In the ordinary act of seeing a jar, the yogi sees the universe. And in that seeing, Bhairava is not other. He is the space that holds both seer and seen.</p>

<h3>Unwavering Presence</h3>

<p class="sanskrit-block">

</p>

<div class="translation">
<p>The awareness of object and subject<br />
is common to all embodied beings.<br />
But the yogi’s distinction lies here:<br />
in every encounter, unwavering presence.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Lakshmanjoo's Transmission</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>All beings experience the duality of <em>grāhya</em> (object) and <em>grāhaka</em> (subject)—the known and the knower. A child, a merchant, a sage—all perceive a flower as “this” (object) and “I” (subject). This dualistic cognition (<em>saṃvittiḥ</em>) is universal.</p>
<p>What sets the yogi apart is not the <em>structure</em> of perception, but its <em>quality</em>: <em>sāvadhānatā</em>—constant, luminous awareness within the act of relating. While ordinary beings are lost in the content of experience—reacting with desire to a friend, aversion to an enemy—the yogi remains fully present in the <em>contact itself</em> (<em>saṃbandhe</em>).</p>
<p>For the yogi, the meeting of subject and object is not a trigger for contraction or expansion of the ego, but a transparent revelation of Consciousness playing as both sides of the encounter. This is the “divine contact”: not withdrawal from relationship, but total immersion without identification.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Extended Commentary</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>Verse 106 reframes enlightenment not as escape from duality, but as mastery within it. The world of subject and object is not denied—it is the very field of realization. The difference is not <em>what</em> is seen, but <em>how</em> it is held.</p>
<p>When an ordinary person sees an enemy, the contact (<em>saṃbandha</em>) becomes a knot: “I am threatened.” When the yogi sees the same face, the contact becomes a mirror: “Here is Bhairava appearing as opposition.” The object hasn’t changed; the depth of seeing has.</p>
<p>“Unwavering presence” (<em>sāvadhānatā</em>) is the yogi’s secret. It is not mindfulness as technique, but as natural state—the continuous hum of awareness beneath all reactions. This presence transforms every interaction into <em>darśana</em>, direct seeing.</p>
<p>Thus, the yogi does not transcend the world of relationships. They sanctify it. In the handshake, the argument, the glance—each moment becomes an altar where subject and object dissolve into the one reality. And in that dissolution, Bhairava is not beyond the encounter. He is the encounter itself—luminous, boundless.</p>

<h3>Another's Body As One's Own</h3>

<p>Feel awareness in another’s body<br />
as you feel it in your own.<br />
Relinquishing concern for your form alone,<br />
within days, you become all-pervading.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Lakshmanjoo's Transmission</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>This dharana cultivates direct, non-conceptual empathy as a path to non-duality. One does not merely <em>imagine</em> another’s pain or joy, but <em>feels it as one’s own</em>—as if the needle pricking another’s flesh were piercing one’s own. This is not emotional sympathy, but the dissolution of the boundary between “my body” and “your body” at the level of sensation itself.</p>
<p>By repeatedly placing awareness (<em>saṃvitti</em>) in the other’s form (<em>anya-śarīre</em>) with the intimacy of self-recognition (<em>svavat</em>), the habitual fixation on one’s own body (<em>āpekṣāṃ sva-śarīrasya</em>) softens. The sense of being a localized entity confined to a single organism begins to dissolve.</p>
<p>As this practice deepens—<em>dinair bhavet</em>, “within days”—the practitioner naturally expands into <em>vyāpī</em>, the all-pervading state. The “fruit” is not virtue, but the collapse of separation: when another weeps, it is not “their” sorrow, but the universe feeling itself.</p>
<p>This belongs to śāktopāya: the power of conscious identification alone becomes the vehicle to universal awareness.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Extended Commentary</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>Verse 107 transforms empathy from moral duty to ontological truth. The ordinary mind says, “Your pain is yours; my pain is mine.” The yogi discovers: <em>There is only pain—and awareness holding it.</em></p>
<p>The instruction is visceral: when you see a beggar’s blistered feet, do not pity—<em>feel the raw skin as your own</em>. When a child laughs, do not observe—<em>let the joy vibrate in your chest as if it were your own breath</em>. This is not projection; it is deconstruction of the illusion that consciousness is owned.</p>
<p>“Relinquishing concern for your form” (<em>āpekṣāṃ sva-śarīrasya tyaktvā</em>) does not mean neglecting the body. It means ceasing to believe the body is the seat of “me.” The body remains, but awareness no longer contracts around it. Like a river that stops calling itself “this stream,” it flows as the ocean.</p>
<p>“Within days” (<em>dinair bhavet</em>) is not hyperbole. When identification with the separate self is pierced daily, the shift is rapid. The practitioner stops asking, “How do I feel?” and begins to feel <em>through</em> all beings—because all beings are the same openness appearing as form.</p>
<p>Thus, this practice is not about becoming compassionate. It is about recognizing that compassion was never absent—only obscured by the fiction of separation. And in that recognition, Bhairava is not “in” all beings. He is the beating heart of all beings.</p>

<p>This is pure śāmbhavopāya—immediate, objectless, and free from all method. One does not meditate <em>on</em> anything, not even on emptiness.

<p>In that groundlessness, one <em>does not allow any thought to arise</em> (<em>vikalpān na vikalpayet</em>)—not by suppression, but by refusing to grant attention to the very possibility of thought. Without support, the mind has no place to stand, no fuel to burn. In that stillness, the individual self (<em>ātman</em>) dissolves into the Supreme Self (<em>paramātman</em>), and Bhairava—the non-dual reality—shines forth not as an attainment, but as what was always already the case.</p>
<p>There is no sequence, no progression, no “practice” in the conventional sense. It is the abrupt cessation of all doing, leaving only being.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Extended Commentary</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>This practice dissolves the very architecture of seeking. To "render the mind supportless" (nirādhāraṃ manaḥ kṛtvā) is not to empty an already-existing container, but to recognize that awareness was never confined to the notion of "mind" in the first place. The instruction "do not entertain a single thought" (vikalpān na vikalpayet) is not suppression, but the natural clarity that arises when attention ceases its habitual grasping at the edges of experience.</p>
<p>Thoughts may still come and go like clouds in the sky, but what is called for here is the absence of inner commentary—the subtle momentum that transforms a passing sensation into "my thought," "my feeling," "my experience." This is not achieved through will, but through recognition: the moment one stops reinforcing the ground on which thoughts stand, their power to define reality dissolves.</p>
<p>In that dissolution—where no foothold for the separate self remains—what emerges is not emptiness but fullness. The phrase "when the self merges into the Supreme Self" (tadātma-paramātmatve) is not a journey of union, but the collapse of the illusion that separation ever existed. Bhairava is not realized as an object of attainment; he is recognized as the ground already present when all supports vanish—not as void, but as the luminous fullness that was never obscured.</p>
<p>This is śāmbhavopāya in its purest expression: not a practice to perfect, but the cessation of all doing. There is no "me" becoming supportless; there is only supportlessness appearing as wakefulness. No technique bridges this gap, because no gap exists. The mind does not "achieve" groundlessness; it recognizes itself as that which was never bound to begin with.</p>
<p>Most crucially, this recognition is not delayed. "Then" (tadā) does not imply sequence—it is the timeless now where contraction meets its end. Like a clenched fist relaxing into open palm, what appears as realization is simply the body returning to its natural state. Bhairava does not "arrive" when thoughts cease; he is recognized as the space in which all arising and subsiding appears—a space that was never diminished by the presence of thoughts, nor enhanced by their absence.</p>

By unwavering conviction in this truth,<br />

</div>

<p class="center">Lakshmanjoo's Transmission</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>This dharana unfolds in two movements. First, one contemplates the nature of Paramaśvara—<em>sarvajña</em> (omniscient), <em>sarva-kartā</em> (omnipotent), <em>vyāpaka</em> (all-pervading)—not as a distant deity, but as the living reality of consciousness itself. Then, one <em>transfers</em> that awareness inward, recognizing: <em>“This very I-am-ness is that Lord.”</em></p>
<p>The phrase <em>śaiva-dharma</em>—“the essential nature of Śiva”—is key. It is not a declaration of identity with a form, but the affirmation that one’s own awareness <em>is</em> the infinite, dynamic intelligence that knows, acts, and pervades all. When this is held with <em>dārḍhyāt</em>—unshakable steadiness—identification with limitation dissolves, and one <em>becomes Śiva</em> (<em>bhavet śivaḥ</em>) not through attainment, but through recognition.</p>
<p>Though it begins with contemplation and affirmation (placing it in śāktopāya), the moment the conviction becomes total, the boundary between meditator and meditated vanishes, revealing the immediacy of śāmbhavopāya.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Extended Commentary</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>Verse 109 is the culmination of non-dual affirmation. It does not say “I am like Śiva” or “I will become Śiva.” It declares: <em>“I am He—here, now, as this very awareness.”</em></p>
<p>The three attributes are not theological claims, but experiential truths:<br />
- <em>Sarvajña</em>: Awareness knows without effort—thoughts, sensations, worlds arise within it, already known.<br />
- <em>Sarva-kartā</em>: All action flows through it—breathing, speaking, dying—none separate from its spontaneous play.<br />
- <em>Vyāpaka</em>: It is not located—present in the ant’s step and the galaxy’s spin, equally.</p>
<p>To “firmly establish” (<em>dārḍhyāt</em>) this is not mental repetition, but living from it. When anger arises, it is Śiva’s energy appearing as anger. When stillness comes, it is Śiva resting as stillness. There is no “me” apart from this flow.</p>
<p>This is śāktopāya because it uses affirmation as a bridge. But the bridge burns away in the crossing. The moment “I am Śiva” is not a thought but the ground of being, practice ends—and what remains is Bhairava.</p>

<h3>All Forms Emanate From The Self</h3>

<div class="translation">
<p>Just as waves rise from water,<br />
flames from fire,<br />
and rays from the sun—<br />
so all forms of the universe<br />
emanate from me,<br />
who am none other than Bhairava.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Lakshmanjoo's Transmission</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>This dharana reveals the non-dual source of all manifestation through natural metaphors. Waves do not exist apart from water; flames are not separate from fire; rays are not distinct from the sun. Likewise, every form of the universe—mountains, thoughts, stars—is a modulation of the one reality: <em>mamaiva bhairavasya</em>, “I, who am Bhairava.”</p>
<p>The practitioner does not merely understand this intellectually, but <em>sees</em> it with open eyes (<em>unmīlana</em>). In the marketplace, in the storm, in the breath—every phenomenon is recognized as a ripple in the infinite ocean of awareness.</p>
<p>Though it begins with contemplation (placing it in śāktopāya), the moment this seeing becomes spontaneous—when duality collapses in direct perception—the method matures into śāmbhavopāya. The universe is not denied; it is seen as the living body of Śiva.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Extended Commentary</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>Verse 110 is a hymn of immanence. It does not place Bhairava beyond the world, but declares: <em>The world is Bhairava in motion.</em></p>
<p>The metaphors are precise:<br />
- <strong>Waves</strong> (<em>ūrmayaḥ</em>) arise and vanish, yet water remains unchanged. So too, forms appear and disappear, but awareness is untouched.<br />
- <strong>Flames</strong> (<em>jvālāḥ</em>) dance with heat and light, yet are never separate from fire. So too, all action and energy are Śakti, inseparable from Śiva.<br />
- <strong>Rays</strong> (<em>bhārgayaḥ</em>) radiate outward, yet are nothing but the sun’s own luminosity. So too, every perception is the self-expression of consciousness.</p>
<p>“From me” (<em>mamaiva</em>) is not the boast of an ego, but the declaration of the absolute: <em>There is no other.</em> The “I” here is not the limited self, but the universal “I” (<em>aham-vimarśa</em>) that is the heart of all beings.</p>
<p>This is <em>unmīlana</em> practice—eyes open, world embraced—not as escape, but as recognition. When you see a leaf fall, you do not see “a leaf.” You see Bhairava falling as a leaf.</p>
<p>Thus, this verse is not poetry. It is instruction. In every moment, look—and see the wave, the flame, the ray—and know: <em>This is me. This is Bhairava. There is nothing else.</em> And in that knowing, the universe does not vanish. It becomes a mirror—luminous.</p>

<p>Wandering long with the body,<br />
then suddenly falling to the earth—<br />
when the agitated energy ceases,<br />
the supreme state is revealed.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Lakshmanjoo's Transmission</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>This dharana uses physical exhaustion as a direct path to stillness. One wanders tirelessly—walking for hours without rest—until the body is saturated with motion (<em>bhrāntvā bhrāntvā</em>). At the peak of fatigue, one collapses abruptly onto the ground (<em>tvaritaṃ bhuvi patanāt</em>), surrendering all effort.</p>
<p>In that sudden cessation, the <em>kṣobha-śakti</em>—the energy of agitation that animated the journey—naturally subsides (<em>virāmeṇa</em>). With no residual will to move or think, the mind, exhausted of its kinetic habit, settles into its source. In that stillness, <em>parā daśā</em>, the supreme state, dawns not as an achievement, but as the natural condition beneath all motion.</p>
<p>Though it begins with action (placing it in āṇavopāya), the moment agitation ceases and awareness rests without support, the method becomes pure śāmbhavopāya—the effortless recognition of what is already whole.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Extended Commentary</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>Verse 111 reveals liberation through total surrender—not philosophical, but somatic. The wandering is not aimless; it is the deliberate exhaustion of the will to control. Like a spinning top that collapses into stillness only when its momentum ends, the yogi moves until movement can no longer be sustained.</p>
<p>The "sudden fall" (<em>tvaritaṃ patanāt</em>) is key. It is not a planned rest, but an involuntary collapse—total letting go. In that surrender, the body becomes a corpse, and the mind, deprived of its habitual anchors (goal, direction, rhythm), has no choice but to return to its origin.</p>
<p>“Agitated energy ceases” (<em>kṣobha-śakti-virāmeṇa</em>) does not mean the energy vanishes. It is reabsorbed. Like waves dissolving into ocean, the kinetic force of wandering returns to the stillness from which it arose. In that reabsorption, what remains is not emptiness, but fullness: the unbroken presence of Bhairava.</p>
<p>This is śāmbhavopāya because no technique is applied. The yogi does not meditate on breath, void, or mantra—only collapses into the earth, and in that collapse, the illusion of separation ends. The ground is not beneath the body; it is the body’s true nature.</p>
<p>Thus, this practice is not about pilgrimage, but about the journey to the end of seeking. When the legs can carry you no further, and you fall into the earth—there, in that surrender, you discover you were never separate from the ground of all being.</p>

<h3>When Mental Capacity Ceases</h3>

<div class="translation">
<p>When, due to inability to grasp objects<br />
through the senses,<br />
or through the mind’s dissolution,<br />
the agitation of absorbed energy ceases—<br />
then the form of Bhairava manifests.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Lakshmanjoo's Transmission</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>This dharana reveals that even incapacity can be a gateway. When the senses (<em>adhāra</em>—bases of perception: eyes, ears, skin, etc.) fail to comprehend their objects—due to blindness, ignorance, or mental exhaustion (<em>asaktyā jñānāt</em>)—the usual stream of cognition halts. Alternatively, when the mind itself dissolves (<em>citta-layena</em>), all interpretive activity stops.</p>
<p>In that gap—where curiosity remains but understanding fails—the energy of knowing (<em>śakti</em>) has nowhere to go outward. It turns inward, not as frustration, but as spontaneous self-absorption (<em>samāveśa</em>). The resulting inner turbulence (<em>kṣobha</em>) soon settles, and in its stillness, <em>bhairavaṃ vapuḥ</em>—the essential nature of Bhairava—shines forth not as a vision, but as the ground of being itself.</p>
<p>Though it arises from limitation (placing it in śāktopāya), the moment the energy reverses into its source, the method reveals the immediacy of śāmbhavopāya.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Extended Commentary</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>This verse illuminates the transparency of apparent limitation. When sensory perception fails—not through defect, but through the natural boundary of all knowing—or when mental constructs spontaneously dissolve, what remains is not deficiency, but openness. The "agitation of absorbed energy" (jāta-śakti-samāveśa-kṣobha) is not the turbulence of failure, but the luminous vibration of awareness no longer contracted around objects. Its "ceasing" is not collapse, but completion: the natural settling of energy into its source.</p>
<p>Lakshmanjoo's Transmission is precise: this is not a technique to manufacture states of incapacity, but recognition when they arise spontaneously. The moment conceptual understanding reaches its natural limit—whether in complex philosophy or simple daily life—the mind's habitual grasping relaxes not through effort, but through its own exhaustion. In that relaxation, there is no "gap to be filled," no "problem to solve," and certainly no "cracks" through which Bhairava must enter. There is only the recognition of what remains when the mind stops projecting its maps onto reality.</p>
<p>The "form of Bhairava" (bhairavaṃ vapuḥ) is not a new experience arising from incapacity. It is the ever-present ground—like the depth of the ocean that remains undisturbed when surface waves subside. The energy that appeared as agitation was never separate from this ground; it was the ground itself in motion. What we call "inability" is simply the moment the illusion of separation thins enough to see through—not to something beyond, but to what has always been here.</p>
<p>This is not śāktopāya becoming śāmbhavopāya; it is the immediate recognition that both were always one. The "energy of knowing" (śakti) does not "reverse course" as if it had ever departed. It simply reveals itself as what it always was: the pulsation of awareness itself, never bound by the appearances it animates.</p>
<p>Most crucially, this is not about attaining knowledge but recognizing the space where all knowing arises. When the mind surrenders its need to comprehend—not through resignation but through the natural exhaustion of all conceptual frameworks—what remains is not ignorance but the luminous fullness that was never obscured. The "curiosity without understanding" is not a doorway to cross, but the very nature of awareness prior to all division.</p>
<p>In its essence, this verse does not sanctify failure. It reveals that what we call failure was never separate from freedom. When the last prop of conceptual understanding dissolves—not as loss but as homecoming—Bhairava does not "arrive." He is recognized as the space in which all arrivals and departures appear.</p>

<p class="center">Lakshmanjoo's Transmission</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>These two verses present direct methods of śāmbhavopāya—immediate, objectless, and free from sequential technique.</p>
<p><strong>Verse 113</strong>: The practitioner fixes the gaze (<em>netrayoḥ stabdha-mātrayoḥ</em>) with eyes wide open, yet without grasping any object. This is not staring, but <em>seeing without seeing</em>—a total suspension of perceptual grasping. In that unwavering stillness, the subject-object split collapses, and <em>kaivalya</em>—absolute aloneness, the state of Śiva—arises instantly (<em>sadyaḥ</em>).</p>
<p><strong>Verse 114</strong>: One simultaneously closes the ears (<em>saṃkocaṃ karṇayoḥ</em>) and contracts the perineum (<em>adho-dvāra</em>, the root center), sealing the lower aperture. In this internalized stillness, attention turns to <em>anākṣam ahalaṃ</em>—the unstruck sound beyond vowels and consonants, the silent vibration of pure awareness. By resting in this inaudible resonance, one enters <em>brahma sanātanam</em>, the eternal ground of being.</p>
<p>Both methods bypass breath, mantra, and visualization. They are not “practices” in the conventional sense, but sudden alignments with the natural state—hence pure śāmbhavopāya.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Extended Commentary</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>These verses distill realization to its essence: <strong>non-grasping</strong>.</p>
<p>In <strong>verse 113</strong>, the eyes remain open, yet perception is unanchored. You do not look at anything; you abide as the open space in which seeing appears. This is not trance—it is hyper-awake presence. The moment the mind stops labeling “this is a wall,” “that is a sky,” the world becomes transparent, and only luminous emptiness remains. <em>Kaivalya</em>—“aloneness”—is not isolation, but the end of separation.</p>
<p>In <strong>verse 114</strong>, the sealing of ears and root center is not muscular effort, but the natural gathering of awareness when attention withdraws from the senses. The “sound without vowel or consonant” (<em>anākṣam ahalaṃ</em>) is not heard with ears—it is the hum of existence itself, the <em>nāda</em> that underlies all sound. To “meditate” on it is to become it: silent, boundless, self-luminous.</p>
<p>Both methods converge on the same truth: liberation is not <em>attained</em>—it is <em>recognized</em> when the mind stops reaching. The “eternal Brahman” is not a place to enter; it is the space that remains when all exits—through eye, ear, and body—are closed not by force, but by the simple, total absence of seeking.</p>
<p>Thus, these are not techniques to perfect, but thresholds to cross—<em>now</em>, in this breath, in this blinkless gaze, in this silent hum. And in that crossing, Bhairava is not found elsewhere. He is the stillness beneath the blink, the silence beneath the sound.</p>

</div>

<p class="center">Lakshmanjoo's Transmission</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p><strong>Verse 115</strong> uses the abyss as a mirror for the mind’s depth. One stands at the edge of a deep well or chasm and gazes fixedly into its bottomless dark. The sheer verticality and emptiness arrest ordinary perception. When the mind is held <em>avikalpa</em>—free from conceptual overlay—in that unbroken downward gaze, thought collapses (<em>citta-layaḥ</em>) not through effort, but through awe. This belongs to śāktopāya, as it uses an external support to induce stillness.</p>
<p><strong>Verse 116</strong> transcends method entirely. One does not direct the mind but <em>releases</em> it—allowing it to wander freely in outer objects (sights, sounds) or inner states (joy, sorrow, desire). In that uncontrolled flow, the practitioner recognizes: every movement of mind arises within the one reality. Since Śiva is <em>vyāpaka</em> (all-pervading), there is no place the mind can go that is not already His state (<em>śivāvasthā</em>). This is pure śāmbhavopāya: effortless, non-dual recognition.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Extended Commentary</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>These verses present two complementary doorways to recognition—one through depth, the other through breadth—but both reveal the same truth: awareness is never separate from what it perceives.</p>
<p>In verse 115, the well is not a technique but a threshold where ordinary perception naturally collapses. When standing at the edge of boundless depth, awareness does not "gaze downward" as an act of will; it is undone by the sheer immensity before it. The abyss does not reflect back an image—it swallows the very sense of being a separate observer. What dissolves is not "mind" as an object to be destroyed, but the contraction that maintained the illusion of a center looking "out there" at something separate. This dissolution is instantaneous not because of effort, but because awareness recognizes itself as the depth. The body may stand at the well's edge, but the one who believed in edges has vanished into the boundless.</p>
<p>Verse 116 completes this realization by addressing the apparent opposite: when awareness flows rather than sinks. The phrase "wherever the mind goes" risks implying a journey from here to there. But when awareness is fully present—whether in the marketplace or in the depths of emotion—there is no "it" traveling anywhere. The mind does not "go" to Śiva's state; it is already saturated with that state. When thoughts arise about outer objects or inner feelings, they are not visitors arriving at awareness; they are ripples appearing within the ocean of what is already whole.</p>
<p>This is not freedom for the mind, but freedom from the mind as a separate entity. Śiva is not "all-pervading" as a quality he possesses—he is pervasion itself. The question "where else could it go?" does not seek an answer; it dissolves the questioner. In that dissolution, even the distinction between well-gazing and mind-wandering collapses. The abyss and the marketplace are equally mirrors of the one reality that never departed. All apparent movement happens within what never moved; all apparent depth exists within what was always whole.</p>
<p>The true teaching is not about gazing or releasing, but about seeing through the veil of separation that made gazing and releasing seem necessary. When standing at the well's edge or lost in thought, what remains when all technique falls away is not an experience to have, but the ever-present ground in which all experiences arise and dissolve—unbroken, unchanging, and already free.</p>

</div>

<p class="center">Lakshmanjoo's Transmission</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>This dharana reveals that every sense perception is a direct manifestation of divine Consciousness. Whether seeing form, hearing sound, or feeling touch, the awareness that <em>knows</em> the object is not personal—it is the very essence of the Lord (<em>vibhoḥ caitanyam</em>).</p>
<p>The practitioner does not withdraw from perception, but dives into its source. At the very moment a pencil is seen or a sound is heard, one recognizes: <em>This knowing itself is Śiva.</em> Since the sense organ and its object are both expressions of the same Consciousness (<em>tan-mātra-dharmitvāt</em>), absorption (<em>cit-layāt</em>) into that knowing—not the known—leads to <em>bharitātmatā</em>: the state of being utterly full, without lack or boundary.</p>
<p>This is śāktopāya: using the immediacy of sensory experience as a portal to non-dual recognition. The senses are not obstacles; they are eyes of the absolute looking upon itself.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Extended Commentary</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>Verse 117 transforms ordinary perception into revelation. It does not ask you to close your eyes or silence sound. It says: <em>Look—but see the seeing. Listen—but hear the hearing.</em></p>
<p>The “sense channel” (<em>akṣa-mārgeṇa</em>) is any aperture of awareness: the eye seeing color, the ear hearing music, the skin feeling wind. In each case, the object is transient, but the <em>awareness of</em> the object is eternal. That awareness is not yours—it is Bhairava’s, appearing as yours.</p>
<p>“Dissolving into pure Awareness” (<em>cit-layāt</em>) means ceasing to identify with the content of experience and resting as the space that holds it. When you see a flower, don’t linger on its petals—dive into the luminosity that allows it to be seen. In that dive, the boundary between seer and seen evaporates, and what remains is not emptiness, but <em>bharitātmatā</em>: the fullness of being that needs nothing added.</p>
<p>Thus, this practice is not withdrawal from the world, but total immersion in its true nature. Every sight, sound, and sensation becomes a doorway—not because it is sacred, but because it is transparent to the one reality.</p>

</div>

<p class="center">Lakshmanjoo's Transmission</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>This verse points to sudden, involuntary thresholds where ordinary mind halts and pure awareness shines through. These are not chosen states, but moments of extreme physiological or emotional intensity—sneezing, terror, despair, disorientation, flight, hunger, or wonder—where the habitual flow of thought is abruptly suspended.</p>
<p>In that split-second gap—between the gasp before a sneeze and its release, between the surge of fear and its interpretation—the sense of “I” vanishes. In that vanishing, <em>brahma-sattā</em>—the living presence of Brahman—is not attained, but <em>recognized as already present</em>.</p>
<p>Because these moments arise spontaneously, without method or support, they belong to śāmbhavopāya. The practitioner does not create these states, but learns to <em>recognize</em> them as gateways. When fear grips, don’t resist—<em>see the space within the grip</em>. When curiosity flares, don’t chase the object—<em>rest in the flare itself</em>.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Extended Commentary</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>Verse 118 reveals that liberation is not confined to meditation cushions—it erupts in life’s raw edges. The “beginning and end of sneezing” (<em>kṣutādyante</em>) is a microcosm: a natural rupture in breath and thought where awareness flashes unmediated. Similarly, in terror—like the dread of a falling sky lab—the mind stops projecting into the future and is thrust into the naked now.</p>
<p>“On the edge of an abyss” (<em>gahvare</em>) or “fleeing battle” (<em>raṇa-dṛte</em>) are moments of total vulnerability, where control collapses. In that collapse, the illusion of a separate self—the one who plans, fears, and survives—dissolves. What remains is not absence, but the fullness of being prior to story.</p>
<p>“Burning curiosity” (<em>kutūhale</em>) is especially potent. It is not intellectual inquiry, but the mind’s sudden halt before mystery—<em>What is this?</em>—before it races to answer. In that suspension, awareness is pure, uncolored by knowing.</p>
<p>“Brahman draws near” (<em>brahma-sattā samīpagaḥ</em>) does not mean grace descends. It means the veil thins. These moments are not “spiritual”—they are human. And in their raw immediacy, the door to recognition swings open.</p>
<p>Thus, this verse is not a technique to practice, but an invitation to <em>wake up at the edges</em>. In life’s ruptures—sneeze, terror, hunger, wonder—the ordinary mind cracks—and through that crack, Bhairava is not found elsewhere. He is the stillness within the storm.</p>

<p>In that total immersion in the past, the present body becomes <em>nirādhāra</em>—devoid of support, as if it no longer exists.

<p>Though it uses memory as a support (placing it in śāktopāya), the moment the present body is rendered unreal through total mental absorption, the practice reveals the timeless nature of consciousness beyond past and present.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Extended Commentary</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>Verse 119 reveals liberation through total immersion in remembered experience. It does not ask you to forget the past, but to <em>re-enter it so completely</em> that present awareness dissolves into that moment. This is not daydreaming; it is deliberate re-creation of sensory and spatial details—like standing again in the garden of childhood or the street of a past city.</p>
<p>When awareness flows entirely into that remembered space (<em>manas-tyajet</em>—"release the mind into it"), the present body becomes <em>nirādhāra</em>: without support, like a phantom. The sense of "I am here now" dissolves. In that dissolution, what expands (<em>prasarati</em>) is not a new state, but recognition of the timeless ground beneath all experience—where past, present and future arise as transient patterns in unchanging awareness.</p>
<p>This practice is not about time travel, but about seeing through time itself. When the knot of linear perception loosens in total recollection, what remains is not memory, but the ever-present awareness in which all moments appear and vanish—unbroken.</p>

<h3>Withdrawing Gaze From Object</h3>

<p class="sanskrit-block">

<div class="translation">
<p>Fix your gaze on any object,<br />
then slowly withdraw the seeing—<br />
along with the knowing of it,<br />
and the mind that holds it.<br />
O Goddess, thus you become<br />
the abode of the void.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Lakshmanjoo's Transmission</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>This dharana traces the reverse path of perception. One begins by fixing the gaze steadily on a chosen object (<em>kvacid vastuni</em>). Then, with utmost slowness (<em>sanaiḥ</em>), one withdraws attention—not abruptly, but as if gently retracting a thread—first from the object’s form, then from the mental impression of it (<em>taj-jñānaṃ</em>), and finally from the very sense of “I am seeing” (<em>citta-sahitam</em>).</p>
<p>In this inward retraction, awareness is not scattered but gathered. As the object fades and the knower dissolves, what remains is not absence, but <em>śūnyālaya</em>—the abode of the void: the open, luminous space of pure subjectivity, uncolored by content.</p>
<p>Since it uses a physical object as the starting point and requires deliberate withdrawal, this belongs to śāktopāya. Yet its culmination—the dissolution of subject and object—is the threshold of śāmbhavopāya.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Extended Commentary</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>Verse 120 is the art of unseeing. It does not deny the world, but reveals it as a temporary knot in awareness. The instruction “slowly withdraw the gaze” is not physical—it is the softening of attention’s grip. You do not look away; you let the act of seeing unravel from within.</p>
<p>“Withdraw the knowing of the object along with the mind” means dissolving the entire perceptual chain: the sight (form), the memory (name), and the sense of ownership (“my perception”). Like a wave sinking back into ocean, each layer returns to its source.</p>
<p>“The abode of the void” (<em>śūnyālaya</em>) is not emptiness as lack, but as fullness without boundary. It is the space where all objects arise and vanish—never stained by their presence, never diminished by their absence.</p>
<p>This practice can be done with anything—a flower, a flame, a stone. The object is irrelevant; the movement of awareness is everything. In the gentle release of seeing, the seer vanishes—and what remains is Bhairava: the silent, boundless ground of all appearance.</p>

<h3>Detached Devotion</h3>

<p class="sanskrit-block">

<div class="translation">
<p>In one who is detached,<br />
the insight born of intense devotion—<br />
that very awareness is Śaṅkara’s eternal Power.<br />
Meditate on that,<br />
and thereby become Śiva.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Lakshmanjoo's Transmission</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>This dharana reveals that supreme devotion (<em>bhakti-udreka</em>)—when utterly purified by detachment (<em>viraktasya</em>)—is not emotional longing, but the spontaneous upsurge of divine Energy itself. In such a state, the intellect (<em>matiḥ</em>) is no longer a faculty of discrimination, but a luminous mirror of pure awareness.</p>
<p>This awakened insight is not personal; it is <em>sā śaktiḥ saṃkarī</em>—the very Power of Śaṅkara (Śiva), self-luminous and unconditioned. The practitioner does not generate this state; it arises when worldly attachment falls away and love for the absolute becomes all-consuming. One then <em>bhāvayet tām</em>—holds that insight as the sole reality—and in that holding, <em>tataḥ śivaḥ</em>, becomes Śiva.</p>
<p>Though it arises from devotion (often associated with dualistic paths), the moment detachment is total and insight is non-conceptual, it becomes śāmbhavopāya: the direct, effortless abidance in the Self.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Extended Commentary</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>This verse describes a precise threshold where emotion transforms into insight. The devotion (bhakti-udrekā) referenced is not ordinary religious sentiment, but an all-consuming intensity that—only when paired with complete detachment (viraktasya)—gives rise to a particular quality of awareness (matiḥ). This awareness is not merely emotional warmth, but the very power (śakti) of Śaṅkara himself.</p>
<p>Crucially, Lakshmanjoo positions this practice within a sequence of refinement. Detached devotion is not an end state, but a transitional condition where the heart's intensity begins to dismantle the structures of conceptual thinking. The resulting insight is not a merger of bhakti and jñāna, but bhakti's natural culmination when purified beyond its dualistic nature.</p>
<p>When Lakshmanjoo notes this becomes śāmbhavopāya "the moment detachment is total and insight is non-conceptual," he maintains important distinctions. Traditional bhakti begins in duality—the devotee and the Beloved are distinct. Only through relentless refinement does this path cross into non-dual recognition. The verse does not collapse devotion into wisdom; it shows devotion's ultimate refinement yields wisdom.</p>
<p>The phrase "meditate on that" (bhāvayet tām) is not identification with emotion. It is the conscious stabilization of awareness in the clarity that emerges when attachment dissolves. This is not the heart overtaking the mind, but the heart refining the mind until both subside into their source. What arises is not "love as reality," but reality revealed through the alchemy of purified love.</p>
<p>This nuance matters: the verse does not spiritualize ordinary devotion. It honors its transformative potential while maintaining the rigor that distinguishes authentic path from mere sentiment. Only when devotion burns away all residues of self-reference does it become the doorway to Śiva. Until then, it remains a powerful, but provisional, support. The culmination is not "love becoming Bhairava," but love's complete surrender revealing what was always present beneath the devotion itself.</p>

<h3>Dissolution Of Previous Objects</h3>

<p class="sanskrit-block">

<div class="translation">
<p>When one object is perceived,<br />
all others gradually dissolve into void.<br />
Meditating on that emptiness in the mind,<br />
even while perception continues,<br />
peace arises.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Lakshmanjoo's Transmission</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>This dharana works through the natural sequence of perception. As one object is actively perceived (<em>vastv-antare vedyamāne</em>—“another object being known”), all previously perceived objects recede into the background. The practitioner does not suppress this process but attends to the <em>dissolution itself</em>—the way each object, once no longer the focus, becomes insubstantial (<em>sanair vastuṣu śūnyatā</em>).</p>
<p>By turning awareness toward this vanishing (<em>tam eva manasā dhyātvā</em>), the mind ceases to cling to any form, past or present. Even while the current object remains in view, the field of perception is seen as permeated by emptiness. In that recognition, <em>vidito ’pi praśāmyati</em>—“even while knowing, one is appeased”—the agitation of cognition subsides, and peace (<em>praśānti</em>) dawns not as absence of perception, but as its transparent ground.</p>
<p>This belongs to śāktopāya: it uses the ordinary flow of attention as support, yet reveals the non-dual space within which all objects arise and vanish.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Extended Commentary</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>Verse 122 reveals that emptiness is not beyond perception—it is perception’s true nature. When you look at a tree, the book you held a moment ago doesn’t vanish; it simply ceases to demand attention. In that fading, it becomes <em>śūnya</em>: not nonexistent, but ungraspable, like a dream remembered upon waking.</p>
<p>The key is <em>not following the new object</em>, but <em>resting in the space left by the old</em>. As each perception yields to the next, a trail of emptiness is revealed. By meditating on this trail—not as void in opposition to form, but as form’s self-release—the mind stops accumulating experience.</p>
<p>“Even while knowing, one is appeased” (<em>vidito ’pi praśāmyati</em>) is the hallmark of the practice. The world continues to appear, but it no longer binds. You see the pencil, yet know it as emptiness appearing as pencil. You hear sound, yet rest in the silence that holds it.</p>
<p>Thus, this practice is not withdrawal, but deconstruction through attention. In the natural rhythm of perception—now this, now that—the yogi discovers that all objects are passing shadows on the screen of awareness. And in that seeing, Bhairava is not beyond the screen. He is the light itself.</p>

<h3>Beyond Purity And Impurity</h3>

<p class="sanskrit-block">
किंचिज्ज्ञैर्या स्मृता शुद्धिः सा शुद्धिः संभुदर्शने।<br>
न शुचिर्नाशुचिस्तस्मान्निर्विकल्पः सुखी भवेत्॥१२३॥<br>

</p>

<div class="translation">
<p>The purity proclaimed by those of limited understanding<br />
is not purity in the vision of Saṃbhu.<br />
Here, nothing is pure, nothing impure—<br />
thus, free from such thoughts, one abides in bliss.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Lakshmanjoo's Transmission</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>This verse dismantles the dualistic framework of purity and impurity (<em>śuci/āśuci</em>) imposed by conventional spiritual systems. The <em>kiṃcid-jñaiḥ</em>—“those of partial knowledge”—prescribe rituals, avoidances, and moral codes based on the belief that certain acts, substances, or states defile while others sanctify.</p>
<p>But in the non-dual vision of Saṃbhu (Śiva), all such distinctions are <em>vikalpa</em>—mental constructs with no basis in reality. The absolute is beyond contamination and sanctification; it pervades all equally. To cling to ideas of purity is to fragment the One.</p>
<p>Thus, the practitioner who sees through this duality—<em>nirvikalpaḥ</em>, free from conceptual division—dwells in <em>sukha</em>, the natural bliss of awakening. This is śāktopāya, for it uses discernment (<em>viveka</em>) to dissolve the very framework of discernment itself.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Extended Commentary</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>Verse 1 23 is a radical declaration of freedom. It does not say “everything is pure,” but “the categories of pure and impure do not apply.” The absolute is not sanctified by ritual or stained by transgression—it is the unchanging ground in which both arise.</p>
<p>This is not license for indulgence, but liberation from judgment. The yogi eats, speaks, and acts without inner division—no “clean” or “unclean,” only presence. A funeral pyre and a temple altar are equally luminous; excrement and nectar are equally appearances of Śakti.</p>
<p>“Free from such thoughts” (<em>nirvikalpaḥ</em>) means the mind no longer fragments reality into opposites. In that non-dual seeing, action flows spontaneously from wisdom, not from fear of contamination or hope for reward.</p>
<p>Thus, this verse is not rejection of ethics, but transcendence of duality. When the last trace of “I must purify myself” vanishes, what remains is not moral chaos, but the effortless harmony of one who has recognized: <em>All is Bhairava.</em></p>

<p class="center">Lakshmanjoo's Transmission</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>This dharana affirms that Bhairava is not hidden in temples or attainable only by sages. His presence (<em>bhāvaḥ</em>) is <em>gocaraḥ</em>—immediately evident—even in the mundane actions of ordinary people (<em>sāmānyeṣu</em>): in their speech, in their labor, in their daily exchanges. When a woman draws water from a well, when two friends meet on the street, when a merchant weighs goods—each act unfolds within the luminous field of divine awareness.</p>
<p>The practitioner recognizes: <em>There is no reality apart from this.</em> (<em>na ca tad-vyatirekeṇa paraḥ asti</em>). The very notion of separation—of “world” versus “God”—is illusion. To see this is to walk the <em>advayā gatiḥ</em>, the non-dual path, where every being, every act, is recognized as the living expression of Śiva.</p>
<p>Though it begins with discernment (placing it in śāktopāya), the moment this seeing becomes total, duality collapses—not as philosophy, but as lived truth.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Extended Commentary</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>Verse 124 shatters the hierarchy of sacred and profane. It does not say the ordinary <em>leads to</em> the divine; it declares the ordinary <em>is</em> the divine in motion. The Vedāntic verse cited—<em>“God is seen by all”</em>—echoes this: the water-carrier knows Bhairava not through scripture, but through the weight of the vessel in her hands, the rhythm of her steps, the sky above.</p>
<p>“Directly perceived” (<em>gocaraḥ</em>) is precise. Bhairava is not inferred; He is the very space in which perception occurs. The market, the field, the kitchen—all are His body. To miss this is not ignorance of doctrine, but inattention to life itself.</p>
<p>“Nothing exists apart from That” is the final undoing of otherness. When you see a stranger’s face, you do not see “other”—you see Bhairava appearing as stranger. When you hear gossip, you do not hear distraction—you hear the absolute vibrating as sound.</p>
<p>Thus, this practice is not meditation apart from life, but life as meditation. In the unguarded moment—when a child laughs, when a bell rings, when breath flows—the door is open. And through it, Bhairava is not found elsewhere. He is the ordinary, seen with extraordinary clarity.</p>

Knowing that Brahman is ever full,<br />
one abides in bliss.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Lakshmanjoo's Transmission</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>This dharana reveals equanimity not as emotional suppression, but as the natural expression of non-dual realization. The practitioner remains <em>samaḥ</em>—undisturbed, unwavering—whether facing love or hatred, praise or blame. This is not indifference, but the recognition that all dualities arise within the one reality: <em>brahmaṇaḥ paripūrṇatvāt</em>, “because Brahman is ever full.”</p>
<p>When fulfillment is not contingent on external conditions, the mind no longer contracts in aversion or expands in attachment. The enemy’s arrow and the friend’s embrace are both seen as ripples in the same ocean of awareness. In that seeing, <em>sukhī bhavet</em>—one dwells in spontaneous joy, untouched by circumstance.</p>
<p>This belongs to śāktopāya: the power of discernment (<em>jñātvā</em>) alone dissolves the illusion that happiness depends on the world’s approval.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Extended Commentary</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>This verse does not ask you to <em>pretend</em> indifference, but to <em>see through</em> duality. The “fullness of Brahman” (<em>paripūrṇatvam</em>) is not a state to achieve—it is the ground of being, always already whole.</p>
<p>When you know this, honor cannot inflate you, nor disgrace diminish you. The cross and the crown are equally luminous. Utpaladeva’s verse—<em>“If victorious, they laugh; if defeated, they laugh”</em>—captures this freedom: devotion so complete that it transmutes all experience into celebration.</p>
<p>“Be the same” (<em>samaḥ</em>) is not stoicism. It is the relaxation of the ego’s desperate need to control outcomes. The yogi acts with full engagement—defending, loving, working—but without inner division. The arrow comes; awareness holds it as play. The embrace comes; awareness holds it as play.</p>
<p>Thus, this practice is not withdrawal from relationship, but total immersion without ownership. In the fire of duality, the diamond of non-duality shines—not because conditions are perfect, but because perfection was never absent. And in that knowing, Bhairava is not beyond the battlefield or the banquet. He is the unshaken heart of both.</p>

Free from both aversion and clinging,<br />

<p class="center">Lakshmanjoo's Transmission</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>This dharana prescribes a middle path that transcends the dual impulses of <em>rāga</em> (attachment) and <em>dveṣa</em> (aversion). The practitioner does not suppress emotion, but refuses to feed it with identification. One does not deny the arising of attraction or repulsion, but does not <em>bhāvayet</em>—nourish, dwell in, or act from—that impulse.</p>
<p>In that non-identification, one abides <em>madhye</em>—in the neutral center between the opposing pulls of like and dislike. This is not indifference, but the space of pure awareness where emotions arise and pass without leaving residue. In that space, <em>brahma prasarpati</em>—Brahman, the boundless reality, spontaneously expands and reveals itself.</p>
<p>Though it points to the immediacy of the center, the instruction to “not cultivate” still involves discernment and restraint, placing it in śāktopāya. True śāmbhavopāya would be the spontaneous recognition of the center without any injunction.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Extended Commentary</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>Verse 126 is not moral instruction, but ontological clarity. <em>Rāga</em> and <em>dveṣa</em> are not sins to avoid; they are contractions of awareness that obscure the whole. When you cling to a friend, you fragment reality into “mine” and “not mine.” When you reject an enemy, you deny the unity of being.</p>
<p>“Free from both” (<em>rāga-dveṣa-vinirmuktau</em>) means the mind no longer leans. It is not that feelings cease—the heart may still flutter or ache—but the inner narrative of “I want this” or “I hate that” dissolves. In that dissolution, the center (<em>madhye</em>) is not a point between two poles; it is the ground where poles never arose.</p>
<p>“Brahman unfolds” (<em>brahma prasarpati</em>) is not an event. It is the natural state when the mind stops splitting the world. In that wholeness, even hatred and love are seen as waves of the same ocean—energies of Śakti playing within Śiva.</p>
<p>Thus, this practice is not about becoming emotionless. It is about becoming so utterly present that emotion no longer binds. And in that freedom, Bhairava is not beyond duality. He is the silent center in which all dualities arise, play, and vanish.</p>

</div>

<p class="center">Lakshmanjoo's Transmission</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>This verse points directly to śāmbhavopāya—the highest means, where no object, no support, and no mental operation remains. One is to contemplate (<em>bhāvyam</em>) not on forms, not on qualities, but on that which lies beyond all designation: <em>avedya</em> (unknowable as object), <em>agrāhya</em> (ungraspable by any faculty), <em>śūnya</em> (void of all content), and <em>abhāvagam</em> (even beyond the notion of non-existence).</p>
<p>This is not negation, but the recognition of the ground prior to all that can be known or unknown. Since there is no object to hold, no attribute to affirm or deny, the mind has nothing to do—<em>it simply ceases</em>. In that cessation, <em>bodha-sambhavaḥ</em>—awakening as spontaneous self-recognition—arises not as an event in time, but as the ever-present reality of Bhairava.</p>
<p>This is pure śāmbhavopāya: the path of immediacy, where even the trace of “meditation” dissolves into the self-luminous silence that is one’s true nature.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Extended Commentary</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>Verse 127 is the razor’s edge of non-duality. It does not ask you to meditate <em>on</em> emptiness, but to rest where emptiness itself is seen as provisional. The four terms map the collapse of all reference points:<br />
- <strong>Avedya</strong>: Not an object of knowledge—not hidden, but prior to the subject-object split.<br />
- <strong>Agrāhya</strong>: Not perceivable—not because it is subtle, but because perception arises within it.<br />
- <strong>Śūnya</strong>: Void—not as absence, but as the open space in which presence and absence play.<br />
- <strong>Abhāvagam</strong>: Beyond non-existence—not annihilation, but the ground in which even “nothing” appears as concept.</p>
<p>To “contemplate all this as Bhairava” is not to imagine a void, but to <em>be</em> the unlocatable space in which all imagining arises. The instruction “see the absence of the spectacles” is precise: don’t see the object—see the <em>not-object</em>, the luminous openness that holds the appearance without being stained by it.</p>
<p>“At its culmination” (<em>tad ante</em>) does not imply progress. It is the moment attention stops seeking—even seeking the void—and collapses into itself. In that collapse, “awakening” (<em>bodha-sambhavaḥ</em>) is not new knowledge. It is the self-evident fact that you were never in ignorance.</p>
<p>Thus, this verse is not a practice to perform, but a mirror held up to the mind. When you look for the unknowable, you find only the looker—and in that finding, the looker vanishes. What remains is Bhairava: not as other, but as your own unbroken heart.</p>

<h3>Spaceless Space</h3>

<p>Fix the mind on the outer sky—<br />

</div>

<p class="center">Lakshmanjoo's Transmission</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>This dharana begins with śāktopāya and culminates in śāmbhavopāya. One gazes at the external sky (<em>bāhyākāśa</em>)—not as a colored dome, but as a symbol of boundlessness: <em>nitya</em> (eternal), <em>nirāśraya</em> (without support), <em>śūnya</em> (void of content), <em>vyāpaka</em> (pervading all), and <em>kalana-ujjhita</em> (free from all conceptual division).</p>
<p>Initially, the sky serves as a support—a tangible image of openness. But as attention deepens, even the subtle perception of “blueness” or “vastness” dissolves. The sky is no longer an object “out there,” but the mirror of one’s own nature. In that dissolution, one enters <em>nirākāśa</em>—the spaceless space, the non-dual reality beyond all spatial metaphor.</p>
<p>This final absorption (<em>samāviśet</em>) is śāmbhavopāya: the spontaneous recognition that awareness was never confined, never localized, never other than the infinite.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Extended Commentary</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>This practice reveals the sky not as symbol but as mirror. When you look at the vast expanse overhead—not as object but as pure seeing—the boundary between inner and outer dissolves not as achievement, but as recognition of what has always been so. The five descriptors are not attributes to mentally superimpose, but signposts pointing back to the awareness that perceives them.</p>
<p>The sky is not "eternal" as a quality it possesses, but reveals the timeless nature of seeing itself. It is not "supportless" as a characteristic, but mirrors how awareness needs no foundation. When you stop conceptualizing the blue dome as "something out there," the sky becomes transparent to the space within which both seer and seen arise.</p>
<p>In that transparency, "entering the spaceless space" is not movement toward a destination. There is no journey from the outer sky to inner emptiness. When conceptual overlay falls away, the sky is recognized not as object, but as the open field of awareness itself—where the one who gazes and the expanse gazed upon collapse into a single, undivided reality.</p>
<p>What we call "nirākāśa" is not a state achieved after contemplating the sky. It is the collapse of the very notion that there was ever separation to begin with. The sky doesn't lead to emptiness—it reveals that emptiness was never absent, never separate, never other than the luminous ground of all appearing.</p>
<p>In this recognition, there is no "entering," no crossing thresholds, no attainment of what was absent. There is only the end of the illusion that awareness was ever confined to a center looking outward. When that illusion dissolves, the sky is not seen as Brahman—it is seen as the mirror in which Brahman recognizes itself.</p>

<h3>Non-Abidance As Path</h3>

<p class="sanskrit-block">
यत्र यत्र मनो याति तत्तत्तेनैव तत्क्षणम्।<br>

</p>

<div class="translation">
<p>Wherever the mind goes,<br />
at that very instant,<br />
let it go—and do not let it rest.<br />
By this constant non-abidance,<br />
one becomes waveless.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Lakshmanjoo's Transmission</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>This dharana uses dynamic non-attachment as a path to stillness. The practitioner allows the mind complete freedom to wander—toward sights, memories, desires—but the moment it alights on any object, one <em>parityajya</em>—releases it immediately, without allowing fixation. This is not suppression, but a gentle, vigilant redirection: not “stop thinking,” but “don’t settle.”</p>
<p>Through this ceaseless letting-go (<em>anavasthitayā</em>), the mind is denied every foothold. Without support, it cannot generate the “waves” (<em>taraṅga</em>) of thought, emotion, or identification. In that groundlessness, <em>nis-taraṅgaḥ</em>—the waveless state of pure awareness—naturally dawns.</p>
<p>Though it begins with an act of discernment (placing it in śāktopāya), the moment the mind becomes utterly supportless, the method reveals the immediacy of śāmbhavopāya: the natural abidance in the still ocean beneath all ripples.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Extended Commentary</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>Verse 129 is the art of conscious restlessness. It does not still the mind by force, but by <em>refusing to let it land</em>. Like a bird denied the branch, the mind eventually tires of flight and dissolves into the sky.</p>
<p>The key is <em>timing</em>: “at that very instant” (<em>tat-kṣaṇam</em>). Not after analysis, not before impulse—but in the split second the mind grasps an object, release it. See a flower? Don’t linger—let it go. Remember a song? Don’t hum—let it go. This is not distraction, but de-identification in real time.</p>
<p>“Waveless” (<em>nis-taraṅgaḥ</em>) is not absence of movement, but the end of turbulence. Thoughts may still arise, but they leave no wake—no residue of “me” and “mine.” The mind becomes like a mirror: images pass through, but nothing sticks.</p>
<p>This practice is especially potent because it meets the mind as it is—fickle, roaming, restless—and turns its very nature into the path. In the constant motion of non-abidance, the illusion of a fixed self evaporates.</p>
<p>Thus, this verse is not about controlling the mind, but about outmaneuvering it. In the space between one object and the next, Bhairava is not found. He is the space itself.</p>

<h3>Unceasing Utterance</h3>

<p class="sanskrit-block">
भया सर्वं रवयति सर्वगो व्यापकोऽखिले।<br>
इति भैरवशब्दस्य सन्ततोच्चारणाच्छिवः॥१३०॥<br>
</p>

<p class="romanized-block">

</p>

<div class="translation">
<p>Bhairava—He who, through fear,<br />
makes all cry out,<br />
who is present in all as the All-Pervader—<br />
by unceasing utterance of this name,<br />
one becomes Śiva.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Lakshmanjoo's Transmission</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>This dharana reveals the power of the sacred syllable <em>Bhairava</em> through its esoteric etymology. The name is not merely a label, but a vibrational key:<br />
- <strong>Bha</strong> signifies <em>bhaya</em>—primordial fear, the shock of confrontation with the unknown;<br />
- <strong>Ra</strong> signifies <em>rava</em>—the cry or resonance that arises from that fear, the raw outpouring of being;<br />
- <strong>Va</strong> signifies <em>vyāpaka</em>—the all-pervading reality that is both the source and substance of that cry.</p>
<p>Thus, Bhairava is the divine presence that <em>elicits</em> the cry through terror and <em>is</em> the cry itself—simultaneously the threat and the refuge. When one recites this name continuously (<em>santatoccaranāt</em>), not as mechanical repetition but as an invocation embodying its full meaning, the practitioner does not “attain” Bhairava—he <em>becomes</em> Śiva, for the name and its essence are one.</p>
<p>This belongs to śāktopāya: the power of the mantra, understood and intoned with full awareness, awakens the reality it signifies.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Extended Commentary</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>Verse 130 transforms fear from bondage into awakening. The cry of terror—“Bhairava!”—is not a plea to a distant god, but the spontaneous recognition that the source of fear <em>is</em> the absolute itself. In extreme crisis, when the mind shatters and the cry erupts unbidden, duality collapses: the one who fears and the one who is feared are revealed as one.</p>
<p>“Unceasing utterance” (<em>santatoccaranāt</em>) does not mean endless vocalization. It is the continuous resonance of that primal cry within awareness—holding the tension of <em>bhaya</em> and <em>vyāpaka</em> together until the knot of separation burns away. When you understand that the scream <em>is</em> the silence that holds it, fear transmutes into awe.</p>
<p>Thus, this practice is not about calming fear, but diving into its core. In the heart of terror, Bhairava is not found as protector. He is recognized as the very ground of the trembling—a presence so total that even fear becomes a hymn. And in that recognition, the one who cried vanishes—and only Śiva remains.</p>

<h3>Self-Referential Thoughts</h3>

<p>In the very midst of assertions like<br />
“I am,” “this is mine,” and so on,<br />
the mind turns toward the supportless.<br />
Spontaneously inspired by this,<br />
one becomes utterly peaceful.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Lakshmanjoo's Transmission</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>This dharana works within the ordinary stream of self-referential thought. As the mind naturally engages in worldly relationships—“I am Lakshmanjoo,” “this is my disciple,” “that is my son”—one does not reject these thoughts, but uses them as a trigger for insight.</p>
<p>In the very act of saying “I am this” or “this is mine,” one notices the <em>groundlessness</em> of such claims. The “I” has no substance; the “mine” has no inherent owner. In that recognition, the mind (<em>manas</em>) naturally turns toward <em>nirādhāra</em>—the supportless reality beyond all identification.</p>
<p>This shift is not forced; it arises <em>tad-dhyāna-preraṇāt</em>—spontaneously, as if inspired by the meditation itself. In that unforced turning, <em>śamiḥ</em>—perfect peace—dawns, not as absence of thought, but as the natural clarity of non-attachment.</p>
<p>Though it begins with attention to ordinary mental activity (śāktopāya), the moment the mind rests in the supportless, it reveals the immediacy of śāmbhavopāaya.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Extended Commentary</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>Verse 131 is a masterstroke of integration: liberation is found not by silencing the ego, but by seeing through it in real time. The phrases “I am,” “this is mine” are not errors to correct—they are doorways.</p>
<p>When you say “I am a teacher,” notice: who is this “I”? When you think “this is my body,” feel: where is the boundary between “mine” and “not mine”? The moment you look, the claim dissolves into open awareness.</p>
<p>“Supportless” (<em>nirādhāra</em>) does not mean the thoughts vanish. It means they float like clouds in sky—unclaimed, unowned. The relationships remain—disciple, son, friend—but the inner grasping that turns them into chains falls away.</p>
<p>“Spontaneously inspired” (<em>preraṇāt</em>) is key. This is not a technique you <em>do</em>; it is a seeing that <em>happens</em>. In the gap between “I am” and the object of identification, awareness wakes up to itself.</p>
<p>Thus, this practice meets you exactly as you are—in the thick of life, tangled in “I” and “mine”—and asks only: <em>Can you let go, even while holding?</em> In that letting go, peace is not achieved. It is recognized as what was always already here: Bhairava.</p>

<h3>Five Attributes Of The Absolute</h3>

<p>“Eternal, all-pervading,<br />
supportless,<br />
omnipresent,<br />
Lord of all”—<br />
meditating on these words<br />
every moment,<br />
one is fulfilled<br />
in exact accordance with their meaning.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Lakshmanjoo's Transmission</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>This dharana uses the power of sacred affirmation as a means to realization. The practitioner continuously reflects on the five attributes of the absolute:<br />
- <strong>Nitya</strong>: eternal, beyond time’s rise and fall;<br />
- <strong>Vibhu</strong>: all-pervading, without boundary or center;<br />
- <strong>Nirādhāra</strong>: supportless, resting on nothing, dependent on no cause;<br />
- <strong>Vyāpaka</strong>: permeating all, equally present in the atom and the cosmos;<br />
- <strong>Akhilādhipa</strong>: sovereign Lord of all, the one reality in which every phenomenon arises.</p>
<p>This is not mere repetition, but deep <em>dhyāna</em>—holding each word as a lens through which to see reality. By dwelling on these truths <em>pratikṣaṇam</em>—at every instant—the mind aligns with their living essence. In that alignment, the practitioner becomes <em>kṛtārthaḥ</em>—“one whose aim is fulfilled”—not by acquiring something new, but by embodying the very nature described.</p>
<p>Since it relies on conceptual contemplation, this belongs to śāktopāya. Yet as the words dissolve into direct experience, the method ripens into śāmbhavopāya.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Extended Commentary</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>Verse 132 transforms metaphysics into lived presence. These five epithets are not theological abstractions; they are mirrors held up to awareness itself.</p>
<ul>
<li>When you feel time passing, remember: <em>nitya</em>—you are the timeless in which time flows.</li>
<li>When you feel confined, remember: <em>vibhu</em>—your awareness is not in the body; the body is in your awareness.</li>
<li>When you seek security, remember: <em>nirādhāra</em>—freedom is not found in supports, but in the courage to stand without them.</li>
<li>When you see separation, remember: <em>vyāpaka</em>—the same light shines in friend and foe, leaf and star.</li>
<li>When you feel powerless, remember: <em>akhilādhipa</em>—you are not a subject ruled by the world; you are the sovereign space in which the world appears.</li>
</ul>
<p>“Fulfilled in accordance with their meaning” (<em>artha-anurūpataḥ</em>) means the words become flesh. You do not “believe” in eternity—you <em>are</em> eternity appearing as this breath. You do not “accept” omnipresence—you <em>live</em> it, walking through the world as the unbroken field of consciousness.</p>
<p>Thus, this practice is not affirmation as self-hypnosis, but as self-recognition. In the echo of these words, Bhairava is not invoked. He is remembered—and in that remembering, the seeker vanishes into the sought.</p>

<h3>Universe As Magical Illusion</h3>

<p>All this universe is unreal,<br />
like a magician’s illusion—<br />
for what truth can there be in a magic show?<br />
Holding this insight with unwavering certainty,<br />
one enters perfect peace.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Lakshmanjoo's Transmission</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>This verse declares the entire manifest cosmos (<em>idaṃ sarvam</em>) to be <em>atattvam</em>—devoid of inherent reality—and compares it to <em>indrajāla</em>, the net of illusion cast by the cosmic magician. Whether the 118 worlds, the body, or personal history, all are appearances without substance, like figures in a dream or actors in a play.</p>
<p>The practitioner is not asked to deny the world’s appearance, but to see through its insubstantiality. The question <em>“kiṃ tattvam indrajālasya?”</em>—“What reality is there in illusion?”—is not rhetorical; it is an invitation to direct inquiry. When one firmly recognizes that all phenomena are empty of independent existence, the mind stops clinging. In that non-grasping, <em>śamaṁ āvrajeta</em>—perfect peace arises, not as a state to achieve, but as the natural condition of awareness freed from delusion.</p>
<p>Though it uses discernment (placing it in śāktopāya), the moment this seeing becomes total and effortless, it reveals the immediacy of śāmbhavopāya.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Extended Commentary</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>Verse 133 is the culmination of non-dual deconstruction. The “magic show” (<em>indrajāla</em>) is not a metaphor for falsehood, but for transparency. Just as a magician’s rope appears as a snake to the deluded but remains rope to the wise, the world appears as solid only to the mind that believes in separation.</p>
<p>The dream analogy is precise: in sleep, the dream world feels utterly real—fear, joy, death—all seem binding. Yet upon waking, one laughs: <em>There was never any Yama, no register, no terror—only mind playing with itself.</em> The waking world is no different.</p>
<p>“Unwavering certainty” (<em>dṛḍhyat</em>) is not intellectual conviction, but the steady gaze that sees every form as fleeting, every identity as provisional. When you look at a mountain and know it as temporary crystallization of earth, or see your own thoughts as passing clouds, the world loses its power to bind.</p>
<p>“Perfect peace” (<em>śamaṁ</em>) is not tranquility in the absence of disturbance, but the unshakable stillness that holds all disturbance as play. In that peace, the universe is not rejected—it is embraced as the luminous dance of emptiness.</p>
<p>Thus, this verse is not nihilism. It is liberation through clarity. When the last vestige of “this is real” vanishes, what remains is not void, but Bhairava: the ever-present, ever-free reality behind the magic—and the Magician himself.</p>

<h3>World As Void Dependent On Knowing</h3>

<p class="sanskrit-block">
आत्मनो निर्विकारस्य क्व ज्ञानं क्व च वा क्रिया।<br>

<div class="translation">
<p>For the Self, ever changeless,<br />
where is knowledge? Where is action?<br />
All outer phenomena arise only in relation to knowing—<br />
thus, this world is void.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Lakshmanjoo's Transmission</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>This verse cuts to the root of all identification. The true Self (<em>ātman</em>) is <em>nirvikāra</em>—absolutely immutable, untouched by modification. In that pure being, there is no room for <em>jñāna</em> (knowing) or <em>kriyā</em> (doing), for both imply change: a subject acquiring knowledge, an agent performing action.</p>
<p>Yet the world of objects (<em>bahir-bhāva</em>) appears only <em>because</em> of knowledge—“I see,” “I know,” “I act.” This dependency reveals its insubstantiality: the world has no independent reality; it is a reflection in the mirror of awareness. Since it exists only in relation to a knower, and the true Self is beyond knower and known, the universe is ultimately <em>śūnyam</em>—empty of inherent existence.</p>
<p>This is śāmbhavopāya: direct recognition that the Self was never the doer or knower, and the world was never truly “out there.”</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Extended Commentary</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>Verse 134 is the final undoing of the doer. It does not deny experience—thoughts arise, hands move—but exposes the illusion that “I” am their source. The immutable Self is like space: sounds echo in it, but space neither hears nor produces them.</p>
<p>“Where is knowledge? Where is action?” is not a negation, but an invitation to look. When you say “I know this,” feel the “I” before the knowing. Is it changed by the knowledge? When you act, is there a “you” behind the movement—or only movement, luminous and free?</p>
<p>The peacock’s feather metaphor is precise: the vibrant colors arise from a colorless plasma. So too, all knowing and doing arise from the changeless ground. The colors are real as appearance, unreal as essence.</p>
<p>“Thus, this world is void” (<em>ataḥ śūnyam idaṃ jagat</em>) is not nihilism. It is freedom. The world remains, but it is seen as play—<em>līlā</em>—of the absolute. Not a solid reality to navigate, but a dance of light on water.</p>
<p>In that seeing, the last vestige of “I am the knower” dissolves. What remains is not emptiness, but the fullness of Bhairava.</p>

<h3>Beyond Bondage And Liberation</h3>

<p>For me, there is neither bondage nor liberation—<br />
these are mere phantoms that terrify the individual soul.<br />
This world is but a reflection in the mind,<br />
like the sun mirrored in rippling water.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Lakshmanjoo's Transmission</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>This verse exposes the ultimate illusion: even the concepts of <em>bandha</em> (bondage) and <em>mokṣa</em> (liberation) are projections of the limited intellect (<em>buddhi</em>), not truths of the Self. The Self—ever free, ever whole—never fell into bondage, and thus never needs liberation.</p>
<p>The individual soul (<em>jīva</em>) trembles before these ideas like a child afraid of ghosts (<em>vibhīṣikāḥ</em>). But just as the sun remains untouched by its reflection in a stream—whether the water is still or turbulent—the absolute remains unaltered by the mind’s dualistic narratives.</p>
<p>When one sees that both bondage and liberation are <em>pratibimba</em>—reflections in the limited medium of <em>buddhi</em>—fear dissolves. True freedom is not the attainment of liberation, but the recognition that one was never bound.</p>
<p>Though it uses discernment (placing it in śāktopāya), the moment this insight becomes total, it reveals śāmbhavopāya: the spontaneous abidance in the Self beyond all pairs.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Extended Commentary</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>Verse 135 is the final release from spiritual ambition. The seeker who strives for liberation is still caught in the dream of separation. Bhairava declares: <em>“I am not liberated—because I was never bound.”</em></p>
<p>The metaphor of the sun in water is exact:<br />
- When the water is calm, the reflection is clear—this is the state of the “liberated” sage.<br />
- When the water churns, the reflection shatters—this is the “bound” soul in turmoil.<br />
But the sun itself? Unmoved. Unchanged. Ever one.</p>
<p>“Liberation” becomes another cage when sought as an achievement. The moment you say “I am free,” you have already created a “me” that was once unfree. True freedom is the silent ground before such distinctions arise.</p>
<p>Thus, this verse is not indifference—it is the highest clarity. In the marketplace, in sorrow, in joy, the yogi acts without inner division, knowing all states are reflections in the mirror of awareness. And in that knowing, Bhairava is not beyond the reflection. He is the light that makes reflection possible.</p>

<h3>Withdrawal From Senses To Abide In Self</h3>

<p>All contact with pleasure, pain, and the like<br />
occurs through the gates of the senses.<br />
Therefore, withdraw from the senses,<br />
and abide, self-established, in your true Self.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Lakshmanjoo's Transmission</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>This dharana reveals that the entire spectrum of worldly experience—pleasure (<em>sukha</em>), pain (<em>duḥkha</em>), excitement, sorrow—arises only through the channels of the senses (<em>indriya-dvārakam</em>). These are not inherent realities, but fleeting impressions conditioned by sensory contact.</p>
<p>The instruction is not to physically disable the senses, but to <em>saṃtyajya</em>—withdraw identification from their play. One does not reject sensation, but ceases to believe “I am the feeler.” In that non-identification, one becomes <em>svasthaḥ</em>—“self-established,” resting naturally in the <em>svātman</em>, the true Self, which is untouched by all dualities.</p>
<p>Though it begins with discernment (placing it in śāktopāya), the moment awareness abides in the Self without reference to sense experience, it matures into śāmbhavopāya—the spontaneous state.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Extended Commentary</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>Verse 136 is not ascetic renunciation, but ontological clarity. The senses are not enemies; they are portals through which the world appears. But the error is not in seeing or feeling—it is in the inner narrative: <em>“This is mine. This affects me.”</em></p>
<p>“Withdraw from the senses” (<em>indriyāṇi saṃtyajya</em>) means refusing to let sensory input define your reality. When pain arises, do not become the sufferer. When joy comes, do not become the enjoyer. Let both pass through awareness like wind through sky—unclaimed, unowned.</p>
<p>“Self-established” (<em>svasthaḥ</em>) is the key. It is not a state you attain, but your native condition when you stop outsourcing your identity to transient experience. The Self is not <em>in</em> the body, reacting to stimuli; the body is <em>in</em> the Self, appearing as vibration.</p>
<p>Thus, this practice is wisdom in action. It does not require special postures or mantras—only the constant return to the question: <em>Is awareness altered by what it witnesses?</em> The answer—never—is freedom.</p>
<p>In that freedom, Bhairava is not beyond the senses. He is the silent witness within which all sensing arises—and vanishes—ever free, ever whole.</p>

<h3>Knower Within Knowledge Itself</h3>

Since they are not two,<br />
the knower is to be seen within knowledge itself.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Lakshmanjoo's Transmission</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>This verse resolves the apparent duality between <em>jñāna</em> (knowing) and <em>ātman</em> (the Self). Knowledge is that by which all objects are revealed; the Self is the pure subjectivity that makes knowing possible. Though they seem distinct—the light and the source of light—in truth they are <em>apṛthag-bhāva</em>: non-separate, inseparable.</p>
<p>The practitioner is instructed to <em>vibhāvyate</em>—discern, contemplate—not as separate entities, but as one reality. When one looks deeply, the knower (<em>jñānī</em>) is found not apart from knowing (<em>jñāna</em>), but as its very essence. There is no “I” behind awareness; awareness is the “I.”</p>
<p>This is śāktopāya: the method of wisdom, where discernment alone reveals non-duality. Yet in the moment of recognition, the distinction between knower and known collapses, revealing the immediacy of śāmbhavopāya.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Extended Commentary</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>Verse 137 dismantles the last subtle division: the belief that awareness needs a “holder.” Knowledge is not a tool the Self uses; it is the Self in action. Like sunlight and the sun—can you separate the radiance from its source?</p>
<p>“Knowledge illuminates the world” (<em>jñānaṃ prakāśakaṃ loke</em>)—yes. But without the Self, there would be no one to whom the world appears. Yet the Self is not a silent witness <em>behind</em> knowledge; it is the luminous openness <em>within which</em> knowledge arises.</p>
<p>“Since they are not two” (<em>anayor apṛthag-bhāvāt</em>) is the pivot. When you see a tree, the seeing is not yours—it <em>is</em> you. The joy you feel is not possessed by you—it <em>is</em> you. The thought that passes is not observed by you—it <em>is</em> you. Awareness and its content are not subject and object, but one seamless flow.</p>
<p>“The knower is to be seen within knowledge” (<em>jñānī jñāne vibhāvyate</em>) means: don’t look for the Self apart from your present experience. In the very act of reading these words, the knower is already present—not as a ghost in the machine, but as the living space of knowing itself.</p>
<p>Thus, this practice is not meditation on an abstract principle. It is the simple, direct seeing that in every moment, awareness and its expression are one taste. And in that seeing, Bhairava is not beyond experience. He is experience, fully awake.</p>

<div class="translation">
<p>O Beloved, when the four—<br />
mind, sentient awareness,<br />
vital energy, and limited self—<br />
have utterly dissolved,<br />
then the form of Bhairava shines forth.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Lakshmanjoo's Transmission</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>This is the culminating verse of the Vijñāna Bhairava’s 112 dharanas. It names the fourfold contraction that veils the Self:<br />
- <strong>Manas</strong>: the mind, source of fragmented thought (<em>vikalpa</em>);<br />
- <strong>Cetanā</strong>: individualized awareness, the sense of “I perceive”;<br />
- <strong>Śakti</strong>: the energy of breath and vital force (<em>prāṇa</em>), the pulsation of embodiment;<br />
- <strong>Ātmā</strong>: the limited ego, the sense of being a separate “I.”</p>
<p>These are not enemies to destroy, but veils to see through. When, through any of the preceding practices, these four dissolve—not by force, but by recognition of their root in pure awareness—what remains is not absence, but <em>tad bhairavaṃ vapuḥ</em>: the luminous body of Bhairava, the unconditioned reality.</p>
<p>This is not a new attainment. It is the end of the illusion that these four ever defined you.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Extended Commentary</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>Verse 138 is the final unbinding. The “four” are the architecture of separation:<br />
- <strong>Mind</strong> divides the world into “this” and “that”;<br />
- <strong>Cetanā</strong> locates awareness in a body;<br />
- <strong>Śakti</strong> binds consciousness to breath and rhythm;<br />
- <strong>Ātmā</strong> claims ownership of it all.</p>
<p>When they “dissolve” (<em>parikṣīṇam</em>), it is not annihilation. It is the collapse of the illusion that they were ever solid. The mind does not vanish—it is seen as thought appearing in space. Breath does not stop—it is recognized as the pulsation of the absolute. The “I” does not die—it is revealed as the open field in which all identity arises and passes.</p>
<p>This is the fulfillment of all 112 methods—not as techniques to perfect, but as doorways to this one recognition. Whether through breath, sound, void, devotion, or fear, each path leads here: to the end of the seeker.</p>
<p>And in that end, Bhairava is not found as other. He is the ever-present ground—unmade, unmeasured, unbound—shining as your own true nature: ever free, ever whole.</p>
<p>Thus, the Vijñāna Bhairava does not conclude with instruction, but with revelation: <strong>You are already That.</strong></p>

<h3>Completion Of 112 Instructions</h3>

<p>O Goddess, I have fully disclosed<br />
one hundred and twelve<br />
instructions for the waveless state—<br />
knowing which, one becomes rich in wisdom.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Lakshmanjoo's Transmission</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>Here Bhairava concludes the revelation, affirming that the 112 dharanas (<em>nistaraṅga-upadeśānām</em>—“teachings for the tideless state”) have been completely imparted. The number is symbolic: 100 represents completeness, and 12 alludes to the full cycle of manifestation (as in the twelve <em>kalās</em> or the <em>dvādaśānta</em>).</p>
<p>These are not mere techniques, but direct portals to <em>nistaraṅga</em>—the ocean of awareness without waves, where thought, emotion, and identity subside into their source. The one who truly <em>knows</em> them—not intellectually, but through embodied recognition—becomes <em>jñānavijjanaḥ</em>: one whose life is saturated with living wisdom, free from the turbulence of duality.</p>
<p>This final verse is both seal and invitation: the transmission is complete, yet the path remains open to all who dare to see.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Extended Commentary</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>Verse 139 is the quiet closure of a thunderous revelation. The “112 methods” are not prescriptions to follow sequentially, but mirrors held up to the many faces of your own awareness. Some are gentle (gazing at the sky), some fierce (the shock of a prick), some simple (listening to breath), some paradoxical (sneezing as awakening)—yet all converge on the same truth: <strong>you are already the waveless ocean</strong> free from mental turbulence.</p>
<p>“Knowing which” (<em>yaj jñātvā</em>) does not mean memorizing verses, but <em>becoming</em> the understanding. The wise one (<em>jñānavijjanaḥ</em>) is not the scholar, but the one in whom wisdom flows as spontaneous presence—unshaken by praise or blame, joy or sorrow.</p>
<p>Thus, the Vijñāna Bhairava does not end with a ritual or a command. It ends with a gift: the assurance that liberation is not distant. It is the very ground of every breath, every blink, every moment—already whole, already free.</p>
<p>And in that freedom, Bhairava and Bhairavī are not two.  They are the one taste of reality.</p>

<h3>Becoming Bhairava Through Devotion</h3>

<p class="sanskrit-block">
अत्र चैकतमे युक्तो जायते भैरवः स्वयम्।<br>
वाचा करोति कर्माणि सापानुग्रहकारकः॥१४०॥<br>

<div class="translation">
<p>If one is fully absorbed in even a single one of these,<br />
one becomes Bhairava himself.<br />
Such a one accomplishes all by speech alone—<br />
bestowing grace or curse through the power of the word.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Lakshmanjoo's Transmission</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>This verse affirms the potency of singular devotion. Among the 112 dharanas, it is not necessary to master them all; deep immersion in <em>even one</em>—with total presence and unwavering focus—is enough to dissolve the sense of separation. When such a practitioner becomes <em>yuktaḥ</em>—united, established—in that one method, they do not “attain” Bhairava; they <em>are</em> Bhairava (<em>svayam</em>).</p>
<p>In that state, speech is no longer mere utterance, but <em>vāc</em>—the creative power of consciousness itself. Words carry the weight of reality: blessings manifest, curses dissolve, not through personal will, but because the speaker <em>is</em> the source from which all manifestation flows. This is not magic, but the natural expression of non-dual realization.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Extended Commentary</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>Verse 140 is both promise and warning. It declares that authenticity matters more than quantity. The practitioner who truly abides in <em>one</em> doorway—whether through breath, void, devotion, or wonder—touches the whole. For the absolute is indivisible; to enter it through any gate is to be <em>it</em>.</p>
<p>“Accomplishes all by speech alone” (<em>vācā karoti karmāṇi</em>) does not mean supernatural command, but the effortless alignment of word and reality. When there is no gap between inner truth and outer expression, speech becomes <em>ṛta</em>—truth in action. A blessing is not a wish, but a revelation of what already is; a curse is not malice, but the clear naming of illusion.</p>
<p>Yet this power is not for display. It arises only when the “I” has vanished—when the speaker is no longer a doer, but the voice of the One. Thus, the verse is not an invitation to seek siddhis, but to recognize: <strong>true mastery is self-effacement.</strong></p>
<p>In that silence behind the word, Bhairava is not invoked.  He speaks.  And in that speaking, the world is made anew—  not as it should be,  but as it always was.</p>

<h3>Freedom From Aging And Death</h3>

<p class="sanskrit-block">

</p>

<div class="translation">
<p>Such a yogi attains freedom from aging and death,<br />
endowed with powers like aṇimā and beyond.<br />
O Goddess, he becomes beloved of the Yoginīs,<br />
lord over all sacred assemblies.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Lakshmanjoo's Transmission</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>This verse describes the fruit of full realization. When one is established as Bhairava, the limitations of mortal existence dissolve. <em>Ajara-amara</em>—freedom from decay and death—is not physical immortality, but the recognition that the Self was never born, and thus never dies.</p>
<p>The <em>aṇimādi-guṇāḥ</em>—the eight great siddhis (aṇimā, mahimā, laghimā, etc.)—arise not as personal attainments, but as spontaneous expressions of unobstructed consciousness. They are not sought; they <em>adorn</em> the one who is free.</p>
<p>Being <em>yoginīnāṃ priyaḥ</em>—beloved of the Yoginīs—signifies harmonious resonance with the dynamic power of Śakti in all her liberated forms. The <em>sarva-melāpakādhipaḥ</em>—"lord of all gatherings"—does not rule over others, but presides as the embodiment of the unity in which all awakened beings naturally converge.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Extended Commentary</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>Verse 141 is not a promise of supernatural feats, but a declaration of ontological freedom. The "end of aging and death" is the end of identification with the body-mind complex. The yogi may grow old, but awareness remains ever fresh; the body may fall, but the Self never perishes.</p>
<p>The siddhis are not magical powers, but the natural transparency of a mind free from contraction. Aṇimā (the power to become subtler than the subtle) is simply the ability to rest as pure awareness, prior to all form. Mahimā (to become vast) is the recognition that one's being <em>is</em> the cosmos.</p>
<p>To be "beloved of Yoginīs" is to be in seamless alignment with the spontaneous intelligence of reality. The Yoginīs are not external deities, but the living forces of perception, energy, and insight—now fully integrated. The "assemblies" (<em>melāpa</em>) are not celestial councils, but the inner harmony of all faculties functioning as one.</p>
<p>Thus, this verse does not glorify the yogi; it reveals the natural state of one who has remembered: <strong>I am not in the world. The world is in me.</strong> And in that knowing, every breath is liberation, every step is grace.</p>

<h3>Untouched While Acting</h3>

<p class="sanskrit-block">

<div class="translation">
<p>Though living in this world,<br />

he remains utterly untouched.</p>
<p>The Goddess said:</p>
<p>O Lord, if this—<br />
the essence of the Supreme—<br />
is as you have revealed,<br />
then, in this very state,<br />
who is there to recite,<br />
and what is there to be recited?</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Lakshmanjoo's Transmission</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>The first part of this verse affirms the state of <em>jīvanmukti</em>—liberation while living. Though engaged in the world (<em>kurvan</em>), the realized being is <em>na lipyate</em>—untouched by action, like a lotus in water. His activity flows from fullness, not need; from play (<em>līlā</em>), not compulsion.</p>
<p>The second part marks a crucial turning point. Having heard the 112 dharanas and their culmination in the identity of the yogi with Bhairava, the Devi asks the ultimate question—not in doubt, but in consummate understanding. If reality is non-dual, if the Self is already whole, if speech itself is the vibration of the absolute—then where is the need for <em>japa</em> (recitation), for <em>japya</em> (the deity to whom it is offered)?</p>
<p>In the state fully established as Bhairava—there is no separation between devotee and divine, no gap between utterance and essence. Mantra, then, is not a means to reach the absolute; it <em>is</em> the absolute resonating as sound. But when even that distinction dissolves, what remains is silence: the space in which all words arise and vanish, unneeded, yet unbroken.</p>
<p>The Devi's question is the razor that cuts the last thread of method. It is not rejection of practice, but the recognition that in the highest state, <em>all practice is already fulfilled</em>.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Extended Commentary</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>Verse 142 contains two profound teachings. First, the essence of jīvanmukti: "Though acting, he remains untouched." The yogi eats, speaks, works—but there is no "doer" behind the doing. Action arises like wind in space: dynamic, yet leaving no trace. In this, he is not extraordinary—<em>he is ordinary, seen without distortion.</em></p>
<p>Second, the final unbinding of spiritual technique. The Goddess, though herself the embodiment of Śakti, poses the question that every sincere seeker must confront: <em>If I am already That, why recite?</em></p>
<p>"Who will recite?" (<em>ko japaḥ</em>)—there is no "I" left to perform the act.<br />
"What is to be recited?" (<em>japaś ca kaḥ</em>)—there is no "other" to invoke.</p>
<p>This is not nihilism. It is the fullness of immanence. When the world is seen as the pulsation of consciousness itself, every breath is mantra, every step is ritual, every silence is prayer. The <em>japa</em> does not cease—it is recognized as the eternal hum of existence.</p>
<p>Yet in the absolute stillness beyond even that hum, there is nothing to do, nothing to say, no one to do it. This is not a state to attain, but the ground already present when all seeking ends.</p>
<p>Thus, the Devi's question is not a doubt, but a mirror. In it, Bhairava sees his own face—and smiles. For in that smile, all 112 methods, all mantras, all worlds dissolve into the one taste:<br />
<strong>Silence, awake to itself.</strong></p>

<h3>Collapse Of Ritual Framework</h3>

<p>O Great Lord, who is there to meditate?<br />
Who is to be worshipped, and who will be satisfied?<br />
To whom is the oblation offered in the fire?<br />
Whose is the sacrifice, and how can it be performed?</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Lakshmanjoo's Transmission</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>The Devi’s inquiry deepens, extending beyond mantra to the entire edifice of ritual and devotion. If the Self is non-dual—if Bhairava is all that is—then the very structure of spiritual practice collapses:<br />
- <strong>Meditation</strong> requires a meditator and an object;<br />
- <strong>Worship</strong> demands a worshipper and a deity;<br />
- <strong>Sacrifice</strong> implies an offerer, an offering, and a recipient.</p>
<p>There is no separation. The fire is not <em>other</em> than the offering; the worshipper is not <em>other</em> than the worshipped. The Devi’s questions are not skeptical—they are the radiant clarity of one who sees to the root.</p>
<p>Her inquiry prepares the ground for Bhairava’s final revelation: that all these acts, when performed with full recognition, are not means to realization, but expressions of it. Yet in the absolute, even expression dissolves into pure being.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Extended Commentary</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>These verses dismantle the scaffolding of religion itself. The Devi, in her supreme wisdom, points to the paradox at the heart of all spiritual life: <em>If God is everywhere, to whom do we pray? If truth is within, what are we seeking?</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>“Who will mediate?”</strong> — When awareness is already whole, there is no “me” to sit in meditation.</li>
<li><strong>“Who will be gratified?”</strong> — When there is no lack, worship becomes play, not petition.</li>
<li><strong>“Whose is the offering?”</strong> — When all is Śiva, the fire, the ghee, and the hand that pours are one vibration.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is not rejection of ritual. It is its consummation. The <em>yāga</em> (sacrifice) is not abandoned—it is seen as the eternal offering of form into formlessness, of wave into ocean. But in the final silence, even the notion of “offering” vanishes.</p>
<p>The Devi’s questions echo in every genuine seeker: <em>If I am already home, why walk the path?</em> The answer is not in words, but in the space between them—the same space Bhairava now reveals as the living heart of all practice and its utter transcendence.</p>
<p>Thus, her inquiry is not an end, but a threshold.  And on the other side—  only Bhairava remains,  not as object of worship,  but as the worship itself.</p>

O gazelle-eyed one,<br />

<p>But the contemplation<br />
that flows without break<br />
in the supreme state—<br />
that is true recitation.<br />
Here, the spontaneous sound (<em>nāda</em>)<br />
is the mantra itself,<br />
and the Self, as universal “I,”<br />
is the one to be recited.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Lakshmanjoo's Transmission</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>Bhairava distinguishes two levels of practice. The external (<em>bāhyā</em>) path—rituals, formal japa, puja—is prescribed for those whose awareness is still coarse (<em>sthūleṣu</em>), not yet refined enough to rest in non-dual immediacy. It is a preparatory discipline, not the ultimate truth.</p>
<p>The real japa is <em>bhāvanā bhāvyate hi yā</em>—the unbroken contemplation (<em>bhūyo bhūyaḥ</em>, “again and again” in the sense of seamless continuity, like a flame without flicker) in the supreme state (<em>pare bhāve</em>). In this, there is no separate “reciter” or “mantra.” The inner resonance—<em>svayaṃ nādaḥ</em>, the self-arising sound of awareness—is both the utterance and the essence.</p>
<p>The <em>japya</em>—the one for whom japa is done—is not an external deity, but <em>mantrātmā</em>: the Self as the very body of mantra, the universal “I” (<em>aham</em>) that pulses as all existence.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Extended Commentary</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>These verses are the turning point: from form to formlessness, from method to immediacy. Bhairava does not condemn ritual; he places it in its proper context—as a raft for those still on the shore of duality. But for the one ready to swim in the open ocean, the raft is left behind.</p>
<p>“Contemplation without pause” (<em>bhūyo bhūyaḥ</em>) is not repetition, but unbroken abidance. Like a candle flame that appears steady though made of countless flickers, true meditation is not a series of efforts, but a single, flowing presence. The moment you “try again,” you have left the stream.</p>
<p>“The spontaneous sound” (<em>svayaṃ nādaḥ</em>) is not heard with ears. It is the hum of being itself—the silent vibration behind thought, breath, and silence. To “recite” it is not to vocalize, but to <em>be</em> it.</p>
<p>And the “deity to be recited” (<em>japya</em>) is not other than you. It is the <em>mantrātmā</em>—the Self as the living essence of all mantra, all sound, all silence. When you realize this, every breath is japa, every step is puja, every moment is sacrifice—and yet, nothing is done, no one does it, and no one receives it.</p>
<p>Thus, Bhairava reveals:  <strong>True worship is recognition.  True recitation is being.  True sacrifice is abidance.</strong>  And in that abidance,  Bhairava is not invoked.  He simply is.</p>

</div>

<p class="center">Lakshmanjoo's Transmission</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>Bhairava now defines <em>dhyāna</em> not as imaginative construction, but as the natural state of <em>niścalā buddhiḥ</em>—a mind utterly still, free from fluctuation. This awareness is <em>nirākārā</em> (without form) and <em>nirāśrayā</em> (without support): it does not rest on any object, internal or external—not the space between breaths, not the brow center, not even the void as a concept.</p>
<p>Mental imagery—whether of a personal deity’s form (<em>śarīra</em>), eyes (<em>akṣi</em>), face (<em>mukha</em>), or hands (<em>hasta</em>)—belongs to preparatory practice for the gross mind. True meditation is the direct abidance in pure subjectivity, where even the subtlest support has been relinquished.</p>
<p>This is not negation of form, but recognition that the ground of all form is formless awareness itself.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Extended Commentary</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>Verse 146 strips meditation to its essence. The word <em>dhyāna</em> is often conflated with visualization, concentration on symbols, or inner imagery. But Bhairava declares: <strong>True meditation is what remains when all that is seen through.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Unwavering awareness</strong> (<em>niścalā buddhiḥ</em>) is not forced stillness, but the natural calm that arises when attention stops chasing.</li>
<li><strong>Formless</strong> (<em>nirākārā</em>) means no shape—divine or otherwise—is held as object. The luminous space of awareness needs no face to be recognized.</li>
<li><strong>Supportless</strong> (<em>nirāśrayā</em>) is the final release: even the subtle reliance on “the gap between breaths” or “the void” is dropped. Awareness rests in itself, not <em>on</em> anything.</li>
</ul>
<p>The rejection of deity visualization is not iconoclasm. It is clarity: such practices are skillful means for the mind still needing form. But when the mind matures, it no longer needs a mirror to see—it <em>is</em> the seeing.</p>
<p>Thus, true <em>dhyāna</em> is not an act. It is the cessation of all doing. In that cessation, Bhairava is not found as an object of meditation. He is the meditator, the meditation, and the silence in which both dissolve—ever free, ever whole.</p>

True worship is merging into that<br />

as total dissolution.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Lakshmanjoo's Transmission</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>Bhairava dismantles conventional ritual to reveal the essence of <em>pūjā</em>. External offerings—flowers, incense, ghee—are symbolic gestures for those still bound by form. But true worship (<em>pūjā</em>) is <em>yā matiḥ kriyate dṛḍhā</em>—the firm establishment of awareness in <em>nirvikalpa para vyoman</em>, the supreme void beyond thought, the boundless sky of pure consciousness (<em>cid-ākāśa</em>).</p>
<p>This is not passive contemplation, but <em>adarāl-layaḥ</em>—absorption born of profound reverence (<em>adarā</em>). It is not rejection of the world, but the total offering of the self into its source. In that surrender, worship is not an act performed <em>by</em> someone <em>to</em> someone else—it is the collapse of the very distinction between worshipper and worshipped.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Extended Commentary</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>Verse 147 is the alchemy of devotion. It does not abolish ritual; it transmutes it. The flower on the altar is not discarded—it is seen as the offering of form back into formlessness. But the <em>real</em> offering is the mind itself, when it stops grasping and dissolves into the open sky of awareness.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>“Not flowers or offerings”</strong> (<em>na puṣpādyaiḥ</em>) means: no external object can bridge the gap between you and the divine—because there is no gap.</li>
<li><strong>“Firm abidance”</strong> (<em>dṛḍhā matiḥ</em>) is not effortful focus, but the natural steadiness of awareness resting in its own nature.</li>
<li><strong>“Supreme, thought-free space”</strong> (<em>nirvikalpe pare vyomni</em>) is not emptiness as absence, but the luminous fullness in which all phenomena arise and vanish unclaimed.</li>
<li><strong>“Merging with reverence”</strong> (<em>adarāl-layaḥ</em>) is key: this dissolution is not annihilation, but the highest honor—like a drop returning to the ocean, not in loss, but in homecoming.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus, true <em>pūjā</em> is not something you <em>do</em>. It is what you <em>are</em> when the illusion of separation ends. In that being, every breath is an offering, every silence a hymn, and every moment the altar where Bhairava is not worshipped—<br />
but recognized as the very ground of worship itself.</p>

<div class="commentary">
<p>This verse affirms the ripening of realization in daily life. The practitioner who is <em>yukti-sthaḥ</em>—steadfastly absorbed in any one of the 112 dharanas—does not experience sudden annihilation, but a gradual yet unbroken unfolding of fullness (<em>bharitākāratā</em>). Each day, experience itself becomes saturated with the presence of Bhairava—not as an added state, but as the very texture of ordinary life.</p>
<p>This is <em>satra tṛptiḥ</em>—the satisfaction of true worship—not a fleeting emotional high, but the deep contentment that arises when every moment is recognized as divine play. And because it stems from non-dual recognition, this fulfillment is <em>atyanta-pūrṇatā</em>—utterly complete, needing nothing beyond itself.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Extended Commentary</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>Verse 148 is the quiet fruition of all prior teachings. It does not promise cosmic visions or miraculous powers, but something far more profound: <strong>the sanctification of the ordinary.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>“Day by day”</strong> (<em>dinād dinam</em>) reveals that awakening is not a single lightning strike, but a deepening clarity that colors each sunrise, each breath, each encounter.</li>
<li><strong>“Ever-full presence”</strong> (<em>bharitākāratā</em>) is not emotional plenitude, but the unshakable sense that nothing is missing—because awareness itself is the only reality, and it is never absent.</li>
<li><strong>“Supreme fullness”</strong> (<em>atyanta-pūrṇatā</em>) is not the end of desire, but the end of seeking. The world continues—joys, sorrows, duties—but none can diminish the inner wholeness that knows itself as Bhairava.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is the ultimate fruit: not escape from life, but life lived in its full depth, where even washing dishes or walking in rain becomes an act of worship—not because it is “holy,” but because the one who acts is no longer separate from the act.</p>
<p>Thus, the 112 methods are not paths to a distant goal.  They are mirrors held up to the truth that is already here—  and in that reflection,  every day becomes a hymn,  every moment a temple,  and every breath a silent “Amen”  to the one reality.</p>

<h3>Offering Into Awareness-Fire</h3>

<p>Real sacrifice is the offering<br />
of the elements, senses, and sense-objects,<br />
along with the mind,<br />

</div>

<p class="center">Lakshmanjoo's Transmission</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>Bhairava reveals the inner meaning of <em>homa</em> (sacrificial fire ritual). The true fire (<em>vahni</em>) is not physical, but <em>mahā-śūnyālaye</em>—the luminous awareness that dwells in the Great Void, the boundless space of pure consciousness. Into this fire, one offers not ghee or grains, but <em>bhūtākṣa-viṣayādikam</em>—the five elements (earth, water, fire, air, ether), the five senses, their corresponding objects (form, sound, etc.), and the mind itself.</p>
<p>The instrument of offering is not a bronze spoon, but <em>cetanā-srucā</em>—awareness as the sacrificial ladle. This is not symbolic; it is the actual dissolution of identification. As each aspect of experience is offered—not rejected, but released—into the fire of non-dual awareness, the illusion of separation burns away.</p>
<p>This is the true <em>yajña</em>: not an external ritual, but the continuous offering of the finite into the infinite, until only the flame remains.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Extended Commentary</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>Verse 149 transmutes ritual into realization. The “Great Abode of Void” (<em>mahā-śūnyālaya</em>) is not emptiness as negation, but the radiant openness in which all phenomena arise. The “fire” is the self-consuming intelligence of awareness—burning all that is not itself, yet leaving nothing destroyed, only revealed.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Elements, senses, objects</strong> represent the entire cosmos of experience—both inner and outer. To “offer” them is not to renounce them, but to see them as transient expressions of the one reality.</li>
<li><strong>Mind included</strong> means even the sense of “I am offering” must be released. The last vestige of doership is consumed in the fire.</li>
<li><strong>Awareness as the ladle</strong> (<em>cetanā-srucā</em>) is precise: the same awareness that witnesses the offering <em>is</em> the means of offering. There is no separate “me” behind the act—only the fire offering itself to itself.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus, true <em>homa</em> is not performed at an altar, but in the heart of every moment. When you see a tree, hear a bird, feel pain—each is an offering into the flame of presence. And in that offering, nothing is lost. Everything is transfigured into light.</p>
<p>Bhairava is not the recipient of sacrifice.  He is the fire, the offering, and the silence after the flame.</p>

<p>O Supreme Goddess, here,<br />
true sacrifice is satisfaction—<br />
marked by bliss,<br />
destroying all impurities,<br />
and liberating all beings.</p>
<p>The sacred field (<em>kṣetra</em>) is<br />
supreme contemplation<br />
and immersion in the Power of Rudra.<br />
Otherwise, for That Reality,<br />
what worship could there be,<br />
and who could be fulfilled?</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Lakshmanjoo's Transmission</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>Bhairava now defines the highest <em>yāga</em> (sacrifice) not as external offering, but as <em>tuṣṭiḥ</em>—the self-subsisting contentment that arises from abidance in the Self. This bliss (<em>ānanda-lakṣaṇā</em>) is not emotional pleasure, but the natural fullness of non-dual awareness. In this state, “sins” (<em>pāpānām</em>)—not as moral transgressions, but as contractions of consciousness—are <em>kṣapayat</em>, dissolved by the light of recognition. And because all beings are expressions of that same awareness, all are <em>trāyate</em>—liberated, protected, restored to wholeness.</p>
<p>The true <em>kṣetra</em> (sacred field or pilgrimage site) is not a geographical location, but <em>parā bhāvanā</em>—unbroken contemplation—and <em>rudra-śakti-samāveśaḥ</em>, total absorption in the dynamic power of Rudra (Śiva). Conventional tīrthas—Kṣīra-Bhavānī, Jvālā—are symbolic; their power lies only insofar as they point the mind inward. The real pilgrimage is the journey into the heart of awareness itself.</p>
<p>The final question—<em>“Otherwise, what worship could there be?”</em>—is the seal of non-duality. If reality is one, there is no “other” to worship, no gap to bridge. True fulfillment (<em>tṛpti</em>) is the end of seeking itself.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Extended Commentary</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>Verses 150–151 complete the transmutation of ritual into revelation. Every element of external religion is reclaimed as inner truth:<br />
- <strong>Sacrifice</strong> is not killing, but the surrender of separation.<br />
- <strong>Sacred site</strong> is not a temple, but the space of pure awareness where all contraction burns away.<br />
- <strong>Purification</strong> is not washing the body, but the dissolution of the illusion “I am impure.”</p>
<p>The etymology of <em>kṣetra</em>—<em>kṣa</em> (to destroy) and <em>tra</em> (to protect)—is exact: in the fire of non-dual awareness, the false self is destroyed, and the true Self is protected—not as something to be guarded, but as that which cannot be lost.</p>
<p>“Immersion in the Power of Rudra” (<em>rudra-śakti-samāveśaḥ</em>) is the culmination of all 112 dharanas. Whether through breath, void, devotion, or wonder, each path leads here: to the recognition that you are not separate from the pulsating energy of the absolute.</p>
<p>The final rhetorical question—<em>“What worship could there be?”</em>—is not skepticism, but the silence that follows all answers. When the seeker vanishes, worship becomes identity. There is no one left to bow, no one to receive the bow—only the one taste of reality, luminous and free.</p>
<p>Thus, the Vijñāna Bhairava does not lead to a shrine,  but to the shrine within: where every breath is sacrifice,  every moment is pilgrimage,  and every atom sings the name of Bhairava—  not as sound,  but as silence.</p>

<h3>Sacred Bath As Immersion</h3>

<div class="translation">
<p>The true Self is essence alone—<br />
freedom, bliss, and pure awareness—<br />
pervading all.<br />
The sacred bath is immersion<br />
in that very nature of one’s own Self.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Lakshmanjoo's Transmission</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>Bhairava now reveals the inner meaning of <em>snāna</em> (sacred bath). External ablution—washing the body with water—is merely physical cleansing. True purification is <em>svātmanaḥ snānam</em>—dissolving the sense of limited selfhood into the recognition of one’s true nature: <em>svatantra-ānanda-cin-mātra-sāraḥ</em>, the essence that is nothing but absolute freedom (<em>svatantra</em>), bliss (<em>ānanda</em>), and consciousness (<em>cit</em>).</p>
<p>This Self is not confined to the body or mind; it is <em>sarvataḥ</em>—present everywhere, the universal ground of all existence. To “bathe” is to withdraw identification from the transient and rest fully in this ever-present reality. In that immersion, all impurity—understood as contraction, ignorance, and separation—is washed away not by water, but by the light of self-recognition.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Extended Commentary</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>Verse 152 is the final purification: not of the body, but of identity. The “bath” is not an act performed <em>on</em> the self, but the self <em>remembering itself</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Freedom</strong> (<em>svatantra</em>) means uncaused, unconditioned being—never bound, never in need of liberation.</li>
<li><strong>Bliss</strong> (<em>ānanda</em>) is not emotion, but the inherent fullness of awareness untouched by gain or loss.</li>
<li><strong>Consciousness</strong> (<em>cit</em>) is the luminous space in which all phenomena arise, yet which remains unmarked by them.</li>
</ul>
<p>Together, these are not qualities <em>of</em> the Self—they <em>are</em> the Self, <em>mātra-sāraḥ</em>—essence alone, without admixture.</p>
<p>The phrase “immersion in that very nature” (<em>tat-svarūpe svātmanaḥ snānam</em>) is precise. It is not a mental affirmation, but total abidance. When you cease to claim “I am this body,” “I am this mind,” and rest as the open awareness in which both appear, you have taken the true bath.</p>
<p>Thus, the sacred river is not Ganges or Saraswati—  it is the stream of your own awareness,  flowing through every moment,  cleansing not the skin,<br />
but the illusion of separation.</p>
<p>And in that purity,  Bhairava is not found as other.  He is the water, the bather, and the light upon the surface.</p>

<h3>Worshipper, Worshipped, And Worship</h3>

all are one.<br />
Then, where is worship?</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Lakshmanjoo's Transmission</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>This verse is the final collapse of all duality in devotion. The flowers, incense, and lamps offered in ritual (<em>dravyaiḥ</em>) are not separate from the Divine (<em>parāparaḥ</em>). The one who offers (<em>pūjakaḥ</em>) is not other than the One to whom the offering is made. All three—offering, offered, and offerer—are the one reality, <em>sa eva ekaḥ</em>—the singular essence of Bhairava.</p>
<p>In this non-dual recognition, the very notion of <em>pūjanam</em>—worship as a transaction between separate entities—vanishes. How can you offer to what you already are? How can you adore what never left you? The question <em>“kva pūjanam?”</em>—“where is worship?”—is not rhetorical doubt, but the radiant silence that follows the end of all seeking.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Extended Commentary</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>Verse 153 is the culmination of the entire Vijñāna Bhairava: a single, luminous stroke that erases the last line between sacred and profane, self and other, means and end.</p>
<p>The garden’s flower is not a symbol <em>of</em> the divine—it <em>is</em> the divine appearing as petal and stem. The incense smoke is not a carrier of prayer—it <em>is</em> prayer made visible. The hands that arrange the offering are not instruments of devotion—they <em>are</em> devotion in motion.</p>
<p>“Transcendent-and-Immanent” (<em>parāparaḥ</em>) is key: Bhairava is not beyond the world, nor confined within it. He is the world’s very substance—both the form and the formless ground from which it arises.</p>
<p>Thus, worship does not cease—it is transfigured. Every act becomes <em>pūjā</em> not because it is directed outward, but because it flows from the recognition: <em>All is That.</em> The marketplace, the kitchen, the meditation cushion—all are altars. The breath, the thought, the heartbeat—all are offerings.</p>
<p>And in that offering, there is no “I” offering to “Thou.”  Only Bhairava,  offering himself to himself,  in the endless dance of love.</p>

<h3>Breath As Willful Motion</h3>

<p class="sanskrit-block">

<div class="translation">
<p>The outward breath departs,<br />
the inward breath enters—<br />
by will, in a coiled motion.<br />
When the Great Goddess stretches Herself fully,<br />
that is the supreme sacred space—<br />
Transcendent-and-Immanent.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Lakshmanjoo's Transmission</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>This verse reveals the inner dynamics of breath as the play of divine will. Normally, prāṇa (outgoing breath) and jīva (incoming breath) move in a “crooked” (<em>kuṭilākṛtiḥ</em>) path—fragmented, unconscious, governed by habitual patterns. But when one breathes <em>icchayā</em>—by conscious will, not mechanically—the breath becomes an act of awareness.</p>
<p>In that intentional breathing, the Kuṇḍalinī Śakti—here called the Great Goddess (<em>mahādevi</em>)—uncoils from her habitual contraction and straightens into <em>dīrghātmā</em>: “long-breathed,” meaning slow, deep, extended in time and subtle in space. This is not mere prāṇāyāma; it is the alignment of individual will (<em>icchā</em>) with the divine pulsation.</p>
<p>In that alignment, the body itself becomes <em>para-kṣetra</em>—the supreme sacred field—not as a location, but as the living presence of <em>parāparā</em>, the reality that is both utterly transcendent and fully immanent.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Extended Commentary</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>Verse 154 returns to the breath—not as technique, but as revelation. The “crooked” breath is the ordinary, unconscious breathing of the unawakened mind—scattered, reactive, bound to the past and future. The “straightened” breath (<em>dīrghātmā</em>) is the breath of presence: slow, deliberate, fully inhabited.</p>
<p>Three energies govern this shift:<br />
- <strong>Prāṇa-śakti</strong>: the automatic life-force, operating even in sleep;<br />
- <strong>Ātma-śakti</strong>: the power of individual will, by which one consciously directs the breath;<br />
- <strong>Prabhu-śakti</strong>: the grace of the Lord, which alone awakens the central channel (<em>madhya-nāḍī</em>).</p>
<p>Bhairava emphasizes <em>icchayā</em>—by will—as the practitioner’s role. You cannot command grace, nor stop the primal life-force—but you can bring awareness to the breath you <em>do</em> control. In that conscious breathing, the crooked path straightens.</p>
<p>“Supreme sacred space” (<em>para-kṣetra</em>) is not a temple or pilgrimage site. It is the body-mind when it becomes transparent to the absolute. The breath, once a sign of limitation, becomes the rhythm of the infinite.</p>
<p>Thus, the sacred is not elsewhere.  It is in the next inhale—  taken not by habit,  but by devotion to presence.  And in that breath,  Bhairava is not invoked.  He breathes.</p>

<p>Abiding in continuous recitation of Her,<br />
established in the sacrificial rite<br />
that is overflowing with supreme bliss,<br />
one merges with the Goddess—<br />
and thereby attains the highest Bhairava.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Lakshmanjoo's Transmission</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>This verse reveals the culmination of the path: not as attainment, but as union. “Her” (<em>asyām</em>) refers to the Great Goddess—the dynamic power of consciousness, the very breath and will that animates all practice. <em>Anucaran tiṣṭhan</em>—“abiding in continuous recitation”—is not vocal repetition, but the unbroken awareness of Her presence in every breath, every pulse, every thought.</p>
<p>The <em>adhvara</em>—the supreme sacrifice—is not a fire ritual, but the living state of <em>mahānandamaya</em>—permeated by great bliss. In this rite, the practitioner does not offer ghee or grains, but offers the sense of separation itself.</p>
<p>To be <em>samāviṣṭaḥ</em>—“merged with the Goddess”—is not metaphorical. It is the total identification with Śakti, the energetic self-expression of Śiva. And in that union, <em>paraṃ bhairavam āpnuyāt</em>—the highest Bhairava is not “reached,” but recognized as one’s own nature. This is the true marriage: not of bodies, but of awareness with its own power.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Extended Commentary</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>Verse 155 is the consummation of all 112 methods. The “recitation” is the silent rhythm of conscious breathing—slow, deep, extended in time (<em>dīrghātmā</em>, as in the previous verse), where each inhalation and exhalation becomes a mantra of presence.</p>
<p>The “sacrificial rite of great bliss” (<em>mahānandamaye ’dhvare</em>) is life itself, when lived without division. There is no altar apart from this moment; no offering apart from full attention. In this rite, the fire is awareness, the offering is the ego, and the priest is the Self.</p>
<p>“Merged with the Goddess” (<em>tayā devyā samāviṣṭaḥ</em>) signifies the end of duality between stillness and motion, Śiva and Śakti. The practitioner is no longer “doing” a practice—they <em>are</em> the practice: breath as devotion, body as temple, awareness as worship.</p>
<p>Thus, union with Bhairava is not a future event.  It is the natural state  when the illusion of separation  has been offered  into the fire of presence—  and what remains  is only one:  luminous, ecstatic.</p>

Thus, it is easy for all—<br />

</div>

<p class="center">Lakshmanjoo's Transmission</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>Bhairava reveals that every being, without exception, performs the <em>japa</em> of the Goddess—21,600 breaths in 24 hours—simply by living. This is the natural, automatic recitation (<em>samuddiṣṭaḥ</em>) of divine energy, the silent mantra of existence itself.</p>
<p>For the <em>jaḍa</em>—the spiritually inert, those asleep to their own nature—this remains mere biological function, yielding no awakening. But for the aware, the same breath becomes <em>sulabha</em>—effortlessly accessible as the highest practice—when infused with conscious will (<em>icchā</em>), as described in the prior verses: breathing slowly (<em>dīrghātmā</em>), reducing spatial extension (<em>tuti</em>), and extending temporal duration.</p>
<p>Thus, the japa is both universal and rare: universal in its occurrence, rare in its recognition. When breath is no longer mechanical but meditative—when each inhalation and exhalation is a full-hearted abidance in the present—the ordinary becomes the path to Bhairava.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Extended Commentary</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>Verse 156 is a profound paradox: <strong>the most esoteric practice is the most ordinary act.</strong> Every human being, every animal, performs 21,600 “mantras” daily—not with lips, but with lungs. Yet only the awakened recognize this as <em>japa</em>.</p>
<p>The key lies not in <em>doing</em> more, but in <em>being present</em> to what is already being done. The “difficult” (<em>durlabha</em>) japa is not a different breath, but the same breath imbued with awareness—slowed, deepened, made spacious in time and subtle in space.</p>
<p>The reference to <em>tuṭi</em> (a unit of 2¼ finger-widths, with 16 such units spanning the traditional breath path) is not literal measurement, but symbolic refinement:<br />
- <strong>16 tuṭi</strong>: ordinary, scattered breathing;<br />
- <strong>15, 14...</strong>: conscious contraction of spatial dispersion, expansion of temporal presence.</p>
<p>As the breath lengthens inwardly, the mind gathers. After days or weeks of this subtle discipline, the practitioner is “born anew”—not through supernatural feat, but through the quiet death of unconsciousness.</p>
<p>Thus, the Vijñāna Bhairava does not demand extraordinary effort.  It asks only this: <strong>Breathe—and know that you breathe.</strong> In that knowing,<br />
the dog, the bear, the sage—  all recite the same mantra.  But only the aware  hear the silence between the breaths—  and in that silence,<br />
Bhairava is not found.  He is the breath itself.</p>

<p>Bhairava concludes with a solemn injunction on the transmission of this highest wisdom. The <em>paramāmṛtam uttamam</em>—the supreme nectar—is not mere knowledge, but the living current of non-dual realization. It must be guarded not out of secrecy, but out of compassion: to reveal it to the unready is to invite misunderstanding, distortion, or misuse.</p>
<p>The unfit are described precisely:<br />
- <strong>Para-śiṣya</strong>: one rooted in another tradition, not yet matured beyond sectarian identity;<br />
- <strong>Khala</strong> and <strong>krūra</strong>: the deceitful and cruel, whose hearts are hardened by ego;<br />
- <strong>Abhakta guru-pādayoḥ</strong>: one without devotion to the Guru, thus lacking the humility that opens the heart to grace.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Extended Commentary</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>These verses are not exclusionary—they are protective. The Vijñāna Bhairava is not a text to be studied, but a mirror to be lived. To give it to one whose mind is still fragmented by doubt, sectarianism, or hardness of heart is like handing a sword to a child—it may be misused, or worse, turned against the giver.</p>
<p>The warning to withhold this wisdom is not elitism, but compassion. When truth is offered before the vessel is ready, it can become a weapon against itself. The unripe mind twists liberation into another form of bondage, non-duality into nihilism, and grace into arrogance.</p>
<p>True protection of the teaching means knowing when silence is the highest form of transmission. And in that silence, Bhairava is not hidden—he waits for the right moment to reveal himself.</p>

<h3>Transmission To The Worthy</h3>

<p>But give it freely<br />
to those whose minds are free from doubt,<br />
to the heroic,<br />

<p>To those devoted to the Guru's lineage,<br />

<p>O gazelle-eyed one,<br />
renounce village, kingdom,<br />

son, wife, and family—<br />

This alone is the imperishable wealth.</p>

<p class="center">Lakshmanjoo's Transmission</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>Having described who should not receive this teaching, Bhairava now clarifies the proper recipients: <em>nirvikalpa-matīnām</em>—those free from doubt and mental agitation; <em>vīrāṇām</em>—spiritual heroes, fearless in commitment to truth; <em>unnatātmanām</em>—those with expansive vision. To them, and especially to <em>bhaktānāṃ guru-vargasya</em>—those devoted not only to their immediate Master but to the entire lineage of awakened beings—the teaching must be imparted <em>nirviśaṅkayā</em>—without doubt or reservation, for their hearts are already open vessels.</p>
<p>He then issues a radical call: <em>sarvam etat parityajya</em>—"abandon all this"—not as literal command for every aspirant, but as a test of value. The true measure of one's readiness is whether one would, if necessary, forsake all worldly attachments—home, nation, family—for the sake of this truth.</p>
<p>For these—<em>grāma, rājya, pura, deśa, putra, dāra, kuṭumbakam</em>—are transient (<em>asthiraiḥ</em>). But this knowledge, this direct recognition of one's nature as Bhairava, is <em>sthiraṃ param idaṃ dhanam</em>—the supreme, unshakable treasure.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Extended Commentary</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>Verses 159-160 complete the teaching on transmission. The worthy disciple is not defined by external credentials but by inner qualities: freedom from doubt, spiritual courage, and expansive vision. Such a one doesn't merely "believe" the teaching—they recognize it as their own inner truth.</p>
<p>The call to renounce all attachments is not monastic instruction but metaphysical reordering of priorities. The list of what to "renounce" is comprehensive:<br />
- <strong>Grāma</strong> (village): local identity,<br />
- <strong>Rājya</strong> (kingdom): power and status,<br />
- <strong>Deśa</strong> (country): national allegiance,<br />
- <strong>Putra-dāra-kuṭumbakam</strong> (son, wife, family): emotional bonds.</p>
<p>All are sacred in their place—but none are ultimate. The teaching asks: <em>If you had to choose between the truth of your being and all these, which would you choose?</em></p>
<p>"Imperishable wealth" (<em>sthiraṃ param idaṃ dhanam</em>) is not metaphor. It is the only thing that cannot be stolen, lost, or destroyed—because it is your very self. Bank balances vanish. Bodies decay. Nations fall. But the recognition "I am Bhairava" stands untouched by time.</p>
<p>Thus, the final message is not ascetic renunciation, but <strong>inner non-attachment</strong>. Live in the world—but let your anchor be the nectar of recognition. Hold your loved ones—but know they are appearances in the one awareness. Serve your duties—but never confuse them with your true identity.</p>
<p>For in the end, all else slips through your fingers— but this truth you cannot lose, because you never possessed it.  You <em>are</em> it.</p>

<h3>Ultimate Fulfillment</h3>

<p>Even life may be surrendered—<br />
but never this supreme nectar.</p>
<p>The Goddess said:<br />
O God of gods, O Great God!<br />
I am utterly fulfilled, O Śaṅkara.</p>
<p>Today I have realized<br />
the essence of the Rudrayāmala Tantra—<br />
the heart of all powers and their divisions.</p>
<p>Having spoken thus,<br />
the bliss-filled Goddess<br />
merged into Śiva’s embrace.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Lakshmanjoo's Transmission</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>Bhairava’s final instruction—<em>na deyaṃ paramāmṛtam</em>—is not prohibition, but protection. The supreme nectar (<em>paramāmṛtam</em>) is the direct recognition of one’s nature as Bhairava. It is not a commodity to be traded, but the living core of existence itself. To “give it up” is to forget oneself; even life is secondary to this truth.</p>
<p>The Devi’s response—<em>paritṛptāsmi</em>—is the seal of realization. Her fulfillment is not emotional satisfaction, but the collapse of all seeking. She has not “learned” the essence of the Rudrayāmala; she has <em>become</em> it—<em>sāram avabudhyatam</em>, fully awakened to the core. The “heart of all powers” (<em>sarva-śakti-prabhedānāṃ hṛdayam</em>) is not a secret doctrine, but the pulsation of awareness itself.</p>
<p>Her embrace of Śiva (<em>kaṇṭhe lagnā śivasya</em>) is not physical union, but the dissolution of subject and object in non-dual being. There is no “she” merging into “him”—only the one reality, recognizing itself.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Extended Commentary</p>
<div class="commentary">
<p>These final verses are not conclusion, but homecoming. Bhairava’s warning—<em>“Never give up this nectar”</em>—is the ultimate safeguard against spiritual materialism. This teaching is not a tool to be discarded when convenient; it is the ground of all being. To abandon it is to abandon life’s meaning—not because it is “holy,” but because it is <em>true</em>.</p>
<p>The Goddess’s declaration—<em>“I am fulfilled”</em>—is the natural state of seeing. No method remains, no path to walk. The 112 dharanas were not steps to climb, but mirrors reflecting what was always present. In that recognition, even “understanding” (<em>jñātam</em>) dissolves: she does not <em>possess</em> the truth; she <em>is</em> the truth.</p>
<p>The embrace is the final silence. No words remain. No “I” and “Thou.” Only the unbroken wholeness where Śakti and Śiva are not two. This is not union of separate beings, but the recognition that separation was never real.</p>
<p>Thus, the Vijñāna Bhairava does not end with a ritual or a command.  It ends as it began:  in the open sky of awareness,  where every breath is mantra, every step is pilgrimage, and every moment is Bhairava.</p>
<p><em>iti śrī-vijñāna-bhairave tantraṃ samāptam</em></p>
<p>Thus ends the sacred Vijñāna Bhairava Tantra.</p>
</div>
